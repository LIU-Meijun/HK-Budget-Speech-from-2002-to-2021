1,2013,[Introduction],"['Mr President,', 'I move that the Appropriation Bill 2013 be read a second time.', ""2.Last month, the Chief Executive announced a series of new policies worth $60 billion in the first Policy Address of the current-term Government. I shall provide financial resources to fully support these initiatives. In this Budget, I am going to introduce proposals in four areas, namely developing the economy, optimising human resources, investing in infrastructure and caring for people's livelihood. I shall also share my thinking about future challenges posed by an ageing population. The package of measures in this Budget will have a stimulus effect of 1.3 percentage points. I hope that with these measures, we shall not only promote economic growth and invest in the future, but also improve employment opportunities and people's livelihood in a bid to address the aspirations of different sectors of the community."", ""3.This is my sixth year as Financial Secretary. Looking back, the Hong Kong economy survived a number of major challenges that threatened to bring our external trade and economic growth to a standstill, take unemployment to an all-time high and see investor confidence fall to an all-time low. I am honoured to have contributed to and steered through the economic rebound and consolidation, shoulder to shoulder with the Hong Kong community. But the road ahead remains bumpy. Challenges to Hong Kong's economic growth, commerce and trading, public finance, financial services, land and development matters abound. With resolve and commitment to serve for the coming five years, I shall continue to do my level best to nurture and grow our economy, to keep Hong Kong a land of opportunities, a place that values fair and just opportunities while caring for the less privileged: a place we truly call home.""]"
2,2013,[Economic Performance in 2012],"['4.The external environment was unfavourable in 2012. In general, there were setbacks in external trade over the year, but domestic demand was stable. Due to weak demand from the advanced economies, the overall economy saw sub-trend growth throughout the year. GDP growth for 2012 as a whole was only 1.4 per cent, much lower than the average of 4.5 per cent over the past ten years.', ""5.The weak fundamentals of the European and US economies weighed on the trade flows in Asia. Hong Kong's exports of goods declined in the second quarter of 2011, the export performance remained weak in the first half of 2012 and improved slightly in the second half. For 2012, exports of goods saw moderate growth by only 1.3 per cent in real terms. Exports of services were also dragged down by the unfavourable external environment and grew by only 1.2 per cent in real terms in 2012."", '6.The domestic sector maintained stable growth in 2012. Thanks to high employment and improved income, private consumption grew by four per cent in real terms for the year. Despite rather cautious business sentiments, building and construction activities as well as machinery and equipment acquisition remained buoyant, further driving up overall investment spending by 9.1 per cent last year.', '7.Realising that our economy was facing a huge downward risk, I introduced a package of measures in my Budget last year which stimulated a GDP growth of 1.5 percentage points. These measures were mainly to support small and medium enterprises (SMEs), help our people, preserve employment and lessen the impact of the economic slowdown. The labour market remained stable in 2012. Despite a slight rebound in the unemployment rate from its low of 3.2 per cent in mid-year to the latest 3.4 per cent, the labour market was still in a state of full employment.', '8.There was a real increase in pay in 2012, even though economic growth was slow and the impact of Minimum Wage has faded. Averaged over the previous year, the pay and wage in the first three quarters of 2012 rose by 6.7 per cent and 5.9 per cent respectively, representing increases of 2.5 per cent and 1.9 per cent in real terms after discounting inflation.', ""9.Inflation has dropped continuously since early last year. This is partly attributed to the reduction in imported inflation due to the retreat of international food and commodity prices and easing inflation in our major import sources. Another contributing factor is the slight reduction in local costs as a result of economic slowdown. The headline inflation rate dropped from a peak of 6.4 per cent in the third quarter of 2011 to 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012, averaging 4.1 per cent for 2012 as a whole. Netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate fell from 6.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011 to 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012, averaging 4.7 per cent for 2012 as a whole.""]"
3,2013,[Economic Outlook for 2013],"[""10.2013 will be a challenging year. While the US has made some progress in tackling its fiscal problems, the pace of its economic recovery remains slow. Though the European debt crisis has temporarily stabilised, the economies there have already plunged into recession. Japan is beset by high debts, and it is difficult to tell whether the Japanese government's stimulus measures will help renew economic growth. Taking a macro perspective of the world's economy, continued modest growth is expected amid downside risks. The quantitative easing programmes launched by the advanced economies facing a prolonged economic downturn will lead to fluctuations in the markets, ultra-abundant liquidity with unpredictable fund flows, and potentially give rise to stronger protectionist sentiments. This, combined with various geopolitical factors, will cast a negative outlook for global trade."", '11.The intricate external environment will remain unstable in the year ahead. The whole world will have to face wars on three fronts, namely ""currency"", ""trade"" and ""geopolitics"". As a highly open and small economy, Hong Kong will be impacted by the development of these wars to a certain extent.', ""12.Fundamentals in Asia remain strong and the Mainland economy regained its growth momentum in the fourth quarter of last year. Barring an abrupt deterioration in the demand from the advanced economies, Hong Kong's external trade should see some improvement. On the domestic front, buoyed by the largely stable labour market, local consumption is expected to sustain modest growth. The pick-up in construction works and vibrant inbound tourism will remain the driving force of domestic demand this year. I expect a modest improvement in our economy this year and forecast Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 1.5 to 3.5 per cent for the year. This growth rate is still lower than the average over the past decade and there may be some upward pressure on the unemployment rate."", '13.The inflationary trend will be affected by the internal and external environments as well as overall demand. On the external front, we must not overlook the risk of increasing international commodity and asset prices arising from excessive global liquidity. Moreover, new rounds of quantitative easing in Europe, the US and Japan may trigger another round of imported inflation. Locally, slow economic growth has eased the pressure on wages. However, given the upcoming upward adjustment to the Minimum Wage in the middle of this year coupled with the persistently high rental levels, inflation will face upward pressure. The average headline inflation rate for 2013 is estimated at 4.5 per cent, with the underlying inflation at 4.2 per cent.']"
4,2013,[Developing the Economy and Increasing Employment],"[""14.As the world's economic balance shifts to Asia, Hong Kong should ride the wave of the new order by capitalising on our unique advantages and exploring new business opportunities to take Hong Kong's economy to new heights."", ""15.During the Budget consultation, many people mentioned the role of the Government in the development of a market economy, and the general consensus was that the free and open mode of economic development which had been the key to Hong Kong's success should be maintained. We maintain a simple and low tax regime while prudently controlling government expenditure to leave most of the wealth to the market and the public. Entrepreneurs, investors and members of the public are free to make their own decisions on business, investment and employment issues, making it possible to use the limited resources more effectively."", '16.This does not mean that the Government is merely reactive. In fact, the Government has been playing a pivotal role in the market economy, especially in times of market failure when it takes steps to restore the market balance to ensure that the community can share the fruits of economic growth. The Government acts as provider of public service, mediator in the allocation of public resources as well as negotiator in discussions with other governments. As I see it, government participation and market operation are complementary concepts. What matters is how to make the two work together, and how to strike a balance between social costs and benefits.', ""17.The current-term Government will continue to count on market forces and act in a rational and pragmatic manner in collaborating with the market to grasp development opportunities and create a better business environment to foster robust economic growth underpinned by our established strengths and foundations. The ultimate objective of economic policies is not about chasing after statistics. It is about expanding the scale of Hong Kong's economy, promoting the holistic development of our society and creating more business and job opportunities so that our people can realise their aspirations and improve their living standards. At the same time, the Government will distribute social resources effectively through appropriate policies and measures so that the needy can be provided with appropriate relief and become self-reliant."", '18.To promote future economic development, we must work on two areas. First, we must foster our economic integration with the Mainland to take advantage of its market development. We know the huge Mainland market well. The Government will make good use of all Government-to-Government (G2G) platforms to help Hong Kong enterprises expand their Mainland business, channel overseas capital to the Mainland market, and support Mainland enterprises in ""going global"". More importantly, we must at the same time preserve Hong Kong\'s characteristics as an international city. We must recognise our biggest advantages - a sound legal system, a level-playing field and an excellent business environment. We treasure our core values of individual freedoms, the rule of law and a clean government, which align us with the international system. We shall support our enterprises by strengthening opportunities in traditional markets, exploring new areas of growth and opening up more new markets.', '19.The Economic Development Commission established by the Chief Executive will provide a new platform for the Government to work with the market in the promotion of economic development. It will develop ideas, advise on strategies and policies, examine the structure of different industries, and explore measures for their development.', '20.Second, we must expand and strengthen our pillar industries to maintain our competitiveness. We must also support the development of new industries, build a more diversified and solid economic base, and provide more career choices for our younger generation to realise their potential.', ""21.Traditional pillar industries have been the major driving forces behind Hong Kong's economic development. They have clear advantages internationally and are highly competitive. Currently, the four pillar industries - trading and logistics, tourism, financial services and business and professional services employ 1.7 million people, or 48 per cent of the total labour force. These pillar industries contribute to 59 per cent of our GDP. With a large economic base, they serve as a powerful driver for related sectors and the job market as well. I shall now introduce measures to further promote these industries.""]"
5,2013,[Consolidating Trading and Logistics  Industry],"['22.The trading and logistics industry consolidates different economic and production activities, and creates numerous jobs with different requirements for academic qualifications, skills and experience. The industry currently employs 770 000 workers and contributes to one quarter of GDP, the highest among the four pillar industries.', 'Modern Logistics Services', '23.Due to changes in market demand, the industry is moving towards the provision of high value-added logistics services. Hong Kong is developing into a regional distribution centre for high-value goods, which differs from its conventional role in transporting components, semi-finished products and finished products.', '24.With an efficient intermodal transport network, the status of a free port and a sound legal system to protect intellectual property, Hong Kong has an edge in handling and distributing high-value goods to markets in the region. Our responsive and efficient logistics enterprises can provide high value-added and ""tailor-made"" services to cater for the different needs of customers in respect of supply chain management. Our logistics industry has potential to further expand its regional services, thereby strengthening Hong Kong\'s position as a logistics hub.', '25.We need to build dedicated facilities to help the development of high value-added logistics services which will help shorten operating time and reduce logistics and inventory costs. We have reserved a logistics site with an area of about two hectares at Tsing Yi which will be put on the market in the first half of this year. We also plan to designate about ten hectares of land at Tuen Mun West for the development of logistics facilities. This will facilitate clustering of companies involved in various operations and services for the industry. Tuen Mun West is an ideal site for this. Upon completion of the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link in 2018, it will only take ten minutes to travel from Tuen Mun West to the Airport. We shall conduct a feasibility study on the proposed development and shall release the logistics sites in Tuen Mun West in phases.', '26.Upon completion of the logistics facilities at Tsing Yi and Tuen Mun West, more than 300 000 square metres of floor area and 7 500 new jobs in various trades will be provided, yielding over $3 billion worth of economic benefits annually.', 'Facilitating the Flow of Goods', ""27.After the 911 incident in the US, various countries enhanced their air cargo security requirements. It is imperative that our freight and logistics operators make early moves to gain greater international recognition in cargo safety and management. This will facilitate the customs clearance of our export overseas, and maintain Hong Kong's competitive advantage as a logistics hub."", ""28.The Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) launched the Hong Kong Authorised Economic Operator Programme last April. The Programme accredits local companies with sound internal safety and management systems in accordance with international criteria, giving their consignments customs facilitation, including prioritised clearance and simpler inspection procedures. The C&ED has liaised with other customs authorities to seek mutual recognition of similar programmes, so that locally-accredited companies can enjoy corresponding preferential treatment outside Hong Kong. The C&ED will allocate additional resources to boost companies' participation in the Programme and promote mutual recognition."", 'Transport Infrastructure', '29.To enhance the external connectivity of our transport network, we shall continue to push ahead with the planning and implementation of, sea, land and air transport infrastructure projects.', ""30.Regarding the proposal of constructing Container Terminal 10 at Southwest Tsing Yi, we are conducting a study to examine the technical feasibility and assess the environmental impact of the proposal. The Study on the Strategic Development Plan for Hong Kong Port 2030 is also under way to update port cargo growth forecasts and explore how to make better use of the existing port facilities to support future development. Both studies are scheduled for completion in the first half of this year. In deciding on the need to construct Container Terminal 10, we shall take into account, among other things, the studies' results and the economic situation and the views of stakeholders."", ""31.On land transport, the local projects of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge are scheduled for completion in 2016 to tie in with the opening of the main bridge. This bridge connection will become part of a strategic road network linking Hong Kong, Zhuhai, Macao and Shenzhen. The Western Pearl River Delta (PRD) will fall within a three-hour commute from Hong Kong. The airport and container ports in Hong Kong can be used for transporting goods from the Western PRD, Guangxi Province and nearby countries such as Vietnam and Thailand. This will strengthen Hong Kong's position as a trade, logistics and aviation hub."", '32.On air transport, the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AA) has commenced an environmental impact assessment and other planning for the three-runway system, which is expected to cope with air traffic demand up to at least 2030. The Government will decide on the development of the three-runway system when all relevant information is available.', 'Emerging Markets', ""33.Supporting local enterprises to tap new markets, facilitating trade flows and promoting economic development are important roles of the Government. The Government's work in this area is of particular importance to the development of the modern trading and logistics industry. With our country's strong support, Hong Kong has submitted to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) a request to join the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area to assist our traders to further tap into the emerging Southeast Asian market. ASEAN member states are currently considering our proposed accession, and conducting internal consultations and studies. We shall continue our lobbying work, and collaborate with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) and local trade associations to organise more business missions and discussion forums to enhance interaction between Hong Kong and ASEAN businesses."", ""34.Our efforts to tap emerging markets have started to deliver results. Over the past five years, with more frequent communication through G2G platforms, the trade in goods between Hong Kong and the BRICS countries grew substantially by over 40 per cent in value. Amongst the BRICS countries, our bilateral trade with India registered cumulative growth of over 90 per cent while that with Russia even increased by 1.5 times. To further diversify Hong Kong's export network, we shall continue our efforts to promote Hong Kong in and strengthen trade links with emerging markets.""]"
6,2013,[Promoting Tourism Industry],"['35.Tourism is another mainstay of our economy, employing some 230 000 people and accounting for 4.5 per cent of GDP. In 2012, there were over 48 million visitors to Hong Kong, an increase of 16 per cent over 2011. Despite the gloomy global economic outlook, total spending associated with inbound tourism increased 16.5 per cent to exceed $300 billion.', '36.Buoyant tourism will undoubtedly put pressure on our control points, hotels, tourist attractions and shopping centres. To sustain the healthy development of the tourism industry, we need to devote more efforts to enhancing tourism infrastructure, hotel supply, market promotion, service support, etc.', '37.Last year, I announced that the Government would look into the further development of Ocean Park and Hong Kong Disneyland. Ocean Park is the winner of the prestigious 2012 Applause Award, the first-ever Asian attraction to be recognised as the best theme park in the world. To further enhance its facilities, Ocean Park will build an all-weather Water World at Tai Shue Wan. The Government will offer a $2.3 billion loan to Ocean Park to spur early commencement of the project. We shall submit a funding proposal to the Finance Committee in the next few months. In the coming few years, Hong Kong Disneyland will launch a new night-time parade and put in place a themed area featuring ""Marvel heroes"", the first of its kind in the world. These new projects will be funded by the Disneyland\'s operating surplus. Meanwhile, the two theme parks are actively pursuing new hotel projects to provide better complementary services for tourists.', '38.The terminal building and the first berth of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal will be commissioned in the middle of this year. Preparations are in full swing for the Terminal to receive its first liner, Mariner of the Seas with a capacity of 3 840 passengers, on 12 June. Meanwhile, we are actively working with the Hong Kong Tourism Board to promote cruise tourism, and collaborate with the travel trade and neighbouring ports on itinerary development and regional co-operation. We aim to exploit the potential of cruise tourism in Asia Pacific and attract more high-spending cruise trip visitors to Hong Kong, so as to reinforce our position as a regional cruise hub.', '39.Increasing the supply of hotels will help enhance receiving capacity and service quality. Currently, there are over 210 hotels in Hong Kong, providing more than 67 000 rooms. The Government has been working to make available more hotel rooms through various measures, including providing ""hotel only"" sites. As at end-2012, 13 applications for redevelopment or wholesale conversion of industrial buildings into hotels were approved by the Lands Department. It is estimated that some 10 000 new hotel rooms will be provided this year and next year.', '40.Following my proposal to extend the operation of the Mega Events Fund last year, we sponsored several major international events, including the Hong Kong Dragon Boat Carnival and the Hong Kong Open Championship (golf tournament). We shall continue to sponsor more international mega events to be held in Hong Kong through the Fund, and use the existing mechanism to subsidise mega events hosted by local non-profit-making organisations. In recent years, our neighbouring cities have organised mega events, such as the Formula 1 Races and overseas NBA games. We shall take the initiative to seek to host more mega events.', '41.In the coming few years, large-scale tourist facilities will come on stream, and there will be major events funded by the Mega Events Fund or hosted in other forms. I believe that the tourism industry will continue to flourish and spur growth in other service sectors, including food and beverage, retail and transport, creating many employment opportunities.']"
7,2013,[Developing Financial Services Industry],"['42.Hong Kong is an international financial centre, and the financial services industry underpins our economy. The industry employs 230 000 people, or six per cent of the total workforce. It is a high value-added industry that contributes 16 per cent to GDP. It is also a major client of professional services and drives growth in other consumer industries. Maintaining the competitive edge of our financial services industry is crucial to economic development. The focus of developing the industry is the diversification of its business and products.', 'Fund and Asset Management Business', '43.The total value of fund assets under management in Hong Kong is more than $9 trillion, ranking second in Asia. As the global economic balance shifts more towards the East, Asia is experiencing some of the fastest wealth growth in the world. We shall seize this opportunity to further develop our fund and asset management business.', '44.To strengthen its position as a premier international asset management centre, Hong Kong will provide relevant legal and regulatory frameworks, and a clear and competitive tax environment with a view to attracting more funds of various types to base in Hong Kong to broaden the variety and scope of our fund business. Hong Kong-domiciled funds will drive demand for professional services such as fund management and investment advice as well as legal and accounting services.', '45.To attract more private equity funds to domicile in Hong Kong, we propose to extend the profits tax exemption for offshore funds to include transactions in private companies which are incorporated or registered outside Hong Kong and do not hold any Hong Kong properties nor carry out any business in Hong Kong. This will allow private equity funds to enjoy the same tax exemption as offshore funds. We shall conduct consultation on the amendments to relevant tax legislation and detailed proposals. ', '46.At present, investment funds established in Hong Kong can only take the form of trusts. As an international financial centre, Hong Kong should provide a more flexible business environment for the industry to meet market demand. To attract more traditional mutual funds and hedge funds to domicile in Hong Kong, we are considering legislative amendments to introduce the Open-ended Investment Company, an increasingly popular form used in the fund industry. We are discussing the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks with regulators. The public will be consulted once a proposal is drawn up.', ""47.To expand the distribution network of Hong Kong's fund industry, the Securities and Futures Commission is studying with the Mainland authorities an arrangement for mutual recognition of funds. The arrangement will attract more funds to establish in Hong Kong and foster the development of those professional sectors engaged in the registration, investment management and sales of funds."", ""48.In addition, the Government has introduced two bills into this Council, with a view to enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness in the development of Islamic finance and facilitating the development of trusts services industry in Hong Kong."", '49.As the Mainland experiences rapid growth in wealth and a steady opening of its capital account, the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) Scheme, which allows investment of Mainland capital in offshore financial markets, is expected to be further relaxed. This will help the growth of the private wealth management business in Hong Kong. The number of private banks in Hong Kong has increased from 27 at end-2007 to 41 now. To tie in with the development of private wealth management, the Government and the regulators will continue to support the work of the sector in setting up a trade association, taking forward programmes relating to the accreditation and enhancing the training of practitioners.', 'Insurance Business', '50.The Government is seeking to introduce a bill into this Council within this year to establish an independent Insurance Authority to align the insurance regulatory regime in the local insurance industry with international practices. This will facilitate the development of the industry and protect the interests of policyholders.', ""51.Many large enterprises in Asia are keen to run their own captive insurance companies to insure against their business risks. To attract more enterprises to form captive insurance companies in Hong Kong, I propose to reduce the profits tax on the offshore insurance business of captive insurance companies, such that they will enjoy the same tax concessions as those currently applicable to reinsurance companies. Attracting a cluster of large-scale captive insurers in Hong Kong will promote the development of other related businesses, including reinsurance, making Hong Kong's risk management services more diversified."", 'Offshore Renminbi Business Centre', ""52.Hong Kong is now the world's largest and most efficient offshore RMB business hub, with the world's largest offshore pool of RMB. Total RMB deposits and outstanding RMB certificates of deposits stood at RMB 720 billion at end-2012."", ""53.Hong Kong also serves as a platform for enterprises and financial institutions all over the world to carry out various financial activities such as RMB payments, financing and investments. RMB trade settlement conducted through Hong Kong banks in 2012 exceeded RMB 2,600 billion, a year-on-year increase of 37 per cent and representing over 90 per cent of the Mainland's cross-border trade settled in RMB. The RMB bond market also showed continuous growth. At end-2012, outstanding RMB bonds issued in Hong Kong exceeded RMB 230 billion, an increase of 62 per cent over end-2011."", ""54.Since the launch of the RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (RQFII) Scheme at end-2011, the range of offshore RMB investment products has been broadened. Among them, Exchange Traded Funds tracking the A-share indices have been well received by the market. We shall continue our dialogue with the relevant Mainland authorities to expedite the next stage of RQFII's expansion, which will include extending the pilot scheme to qualified Hong Kong financial institutions. These measures will promote the circulation of RMB funds and diversify the development of RMB investment products. We shall continue to strengthen our market infrastructure, and stay connected with other financial centres in the world with a view to further enhancing the use of RMB for trade settlement, financing and investment at the international level, consolidating Hong Kong's position as an offshore RMB business centre."", 'Basel III', '55.The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision announced in early January the details of the revised regulatory liquidity standards of Basel III to be implemented progressively between 2015 and 2019. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is assessing the impact of the revision on the local banking sector to draw up a corresponding implementation plan for industry consultation. We shall devise regulatory rules that suit our financial markets and business environment to promote the stability of our banking system.', 'Government Bond Programme', '56.Since the launch of the Government Bond Programme in 2009, the systematic offering of bonds has attracted local and overseas investors to the Hong Kong bond market and expanded the investment base. As at early February this year, outstanding bonds issued under the Programme totalled about $70 billion.', '57.Given the situation of global financial markets, there has been a sustained growth in the demand from investors and financial institutions in Asia and other emerging markets for high quality public debt papers, including Hong Kong Dollar government debt. I hope that the Government Bond Programme can be expanded to meet the criteria of certain global benchmark bond indices to attract more investors. To further promote the sustainable development of our bond market, I propose to expand the size of the Government Bond Programme from the current $100 billion to $200 billion to provide adequate room for the Programme to continue in the next five years. We shall move in due course an amendment resolution in this Council to raise the maximum amount of borrowings under the Government Bond Programme.', ""58.The Government also issued two sets of inflation-linked retail bonds (iBond) under the Government Bond Programme. Both the total amount of applications and the total application amounts for the iBond issued last year set a new record for local retail bonds, reflecting the investing public's greater awareness of, and interest in, retail bonds. To maintain this growth momentum, I propose launching a further iBond issue of up to $10 billion under the Government Bond Programme. The iBond, with a maturity of three years, will target Hong Kong residents. Interest will be paid to bond holders once every six months at a rate linked to the inflation rates of the last half-year period. The HKMA will announce the details in due course. I have to point out that the further issuance of iBond is a measure to address the current low-interest rate environment. It is a non-recurrent measure. In the long run, the Government will not confine bond issuance to a particular type of bonds. We shall develop different types of bonds for a more diversified bond market in Hong Kong."", 'Stored Value Facilities and Retail Payment Systems', '59.Over the past ten years, the number of local internet banking accounts has increased at an average annual rate of 22 per cent to over eight million at present, with an average transaction volume of around $4 trillion per month. Shopping and bill paying on innovative online and electronic payment platforms are becoming increasingly popular. The development of electronic payment instruments and retail payment systems can make payment processing more efficient for companies, especially those in the retail industry. Such development will encourage local enterprises to extend their global sales networks, and stimulate the growth of other ancillary trades, including electronic transaction services and computer system developments. We are considering possible amendments to the legislation to introduce a licensing regime for stored value electronic money and to empower the HKMA to supervise the relevant retail payment systems, which will help establish a sound regulatory regime for Hong Kong.', '60.Given the rapid developments in the global financial markets, the Government needs to tap advice from market experts. The Chief Executive has announced the establishment of the Financial Services Development Council, a high-level, cross-sector advisory body, to offer views and suggestions to the Government on developing and promoting our financial services industry as well as reinforcing our position as an international financial centre.']"
8,2013,[Expanding Business and Professional  Services],"['61.With some  470 000 employees and accounting for 12 per cent of GDP, business support and professional services are another pillar industry of the Hong Kong economy. They comprise a wide range of professional and supporting services for business activities, such as legal, accounting, architecture, engineering, planning, surveying, human resources, management consultancy, technical testing, product development and distribution, market research, conference and exhibition, and information technology.', ""62.Apart from serving local enterprises, Hong Kong's business and professional services are also exported to the Mainland and other areas in Asia. We shall continue to assist these service industries through relevant G2G platforms. Under the National 12th Five-Year Plan, the Mainland will devote greater efforts to developing modern service industries to lift the share of the service industries in the economy by four percentage points by 2015. Such scale of expansion far exceeds Hong Kong's GDP in one year. This will present vast business opportunities to the sectors concerned in Hong Kong. For continuous enhancement of the CEPA mechanism, the Chief Executive has announced that the HKSAR Government and the Ministry of Commerce will set up a joint working group to assist the sectors concerned to solve problems they encounter in gaining access to the Mainland market under CEPA.""]"
9,2013,[Nurturing Emerging Industries],"[""63.Apart from building on our traditional strengths, we also give strong support for the development of emerging industries to further diversify our economy, so that Hong Kong can better respond to the world's ever-changing economic environment. Over the past couple of years, the Government has promoted six industries where Hong Kong enjoys clear advantages. These industries employ 420 000 people, or 12 per cent of the total workforce, and contribute to 8.5 per cent of GDP. The Government will keep an eye on the development of new industries and proactively provide appropriate support for emerging industries with the potential to flourish."", '64.On nurturing emerging industries, the efforts of the Government and the industries concerned have borne fruit. Among the emerging industries, the cultural and creative industries, employing 190 000 persons, have been taking up an increasing share of GDP, which now approaches five per cent. To the credit of these practitioners, they have won numerous international awards and accolades. Apart from the film industry, other industries in the sector also made impressive achievements. Despite the global economic slowdown over the past few years, our design and architecture sectors have, during the five years leading up to 2011, achieved an average annual growth rate of 20 per cent in terms of value added and five per cent in terms of the number of practitioners. Another notable achievement is that local advertising companies scooped a total of 60 awards in three different international advertising competitions. In 2011, local enterprises spent more than $35 billion on advertising, an increase of 16 per cent over the previous year. The local advertising industry continues to boom, employing 18 000 people and bringing $6.8 billion worth of economic benefits. With the huge domestic demand in the Mainland as a result of sustained economic growth, our cultural and creative industries have great development potential. We shall continue to provide strong support for the industries with a view to opening up more business opportunities and markets.', '65.In recent years, Hong Kong has played host to a number of art fairs which have attracted many well-established art galleries from different corners of the world. We shall host a number of world-class art fairs again this year, including Art Basel - Hong Kong, inaugural show in Asia. These major events will help pool overseas and local art-related participants and foster interaction and exchanges among them. Successful art fairs will also facilitate art and cultural development in Hong Kong, and highlight our potential as an international art metropolis.', ""66.To foster the development of visual arts and nurture local talent in the field, we are converting the club house of the former Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club in Oil Street, North Point into a visual arts exhibition and activity centre. I also propose additional funding of $50 million for the Leisure and Cultural Services Department to acquire local visual artists' outstanding artworks, and to commission works for exhibition under public art schemes. These are set to promote the profile of local artists and bring their works to the attention of the art market."", '67.Today, many internationally renowned scholars work in local universities to conduct research. Their efforts contribute to the development of Hong Kong\'s research and development (R&D) capabilities. Top researchers working in our universities and enterprises have won numerous awards.

To facilitate technology transfers and the realisation of R&D results, six local universities have set up their own technology transfer offices to deal with the complicated process of commercialising R&D results. I propose that these six universities be each provided with a subvention of up to $12 million through the ITF for a period of three years from 2013-14 onwards to support the work of their technology transfer offices."", '69.Technology and product R&D will stimulate the development of intellectual property trading. Hong Kong has a sound regime for the protection of intellectual property rights, and is well-equipped to develop into a regional intellectual property trading hub. The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development will lead a working group to study the overall strategy for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for intellectual property trading.']"
