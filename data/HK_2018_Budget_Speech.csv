0,Introduction,"['Mr President,Honourable Members and fellow citizens,', 'I move that the Appropriation Bill 2018 be read a second time.', 'Introduction', '2.At the start of the Chinese New Year, I deliver the first Budget of the current-term Government with a thankful heart.', '3.Over the past few weeks, the public has engaged in extensive discussions and expressed diverse opinions on the Budget. I am indebted to you all, and appreciate fully that various sectors of the community have different needs and aspirations.', ""4.The preparation of this year's Budget has enlightened me in many ways. Budget consultation has revealed once again the wide-ranging, diverse and even conflicting demands within the community. At the same time, it has brought me closer to the public, enabling me to see things from the perspective of the people whom I serve, so that I could consider how best to use the resources pooled from them to meet their needs and those of Hong Kong. Therefore, in preparing the speech, I have placed much emphasis on explaining, in a more systematic way, the Government's priorities in using public resources, as well as our visions for the future, development direction and financial planning."", '5.The initiatives put forward in this Budget are underpinned by three main objectives: (1) Diversified economy: we have to diversify our economy to create wealth for Hong Kong and provide wider and better development opportunities for our young people. (2) Investing for the future: the outbreak of winter influenza has reminded us once again of the pressing need to improve healthcare services; an ageing population poses challenges which need to be overcome by deploying resources and making early preparation; and we also need to improve our living environment to make Hong Kong an ideal smart city to work and live in. (3) Caring and sharing: children and young people should be given more care, protection and opportunities; middle-class families need relief from financial burdens, while the grassroots and underprivileged require more support. Besides, a fulfilling life calls for not only materialistic improvements, but also better quality of life and spiritual enrichment.', '6.In reality, no abundance of resources would ever enable the Government to satisfy the needs of all. It is my responsibility to take care of various sectors of the community. While addressing the pressing needs, I must also be proactive, innovative and bold in investing for the future of Hong Kong. I will elaborate on this in the ensuing parts of my speech.']"
1,EconomicDevelopment,"['EconomicDevelopment', ""7.The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of Hong Kong amounts to US$46,000, and is among the highest in the world. However, our average annual economic growth rate over the past decade was merely 2.7 per cent, reflecting a slower growth momentum. We must leverage our strength and take a forward-looking approach in positioning our future development and seeking new impetus. This will enable our economy to grow in a diversified manner, provide our young people with more room for development and improve people's quality of life.""]"
2,Global Trends,"['Global Trends', '8.In view of the global economic landscape, we need to keep abreast of three major trends and ride on them.', '9.First, the unstoppable wave of innovation and technology (I&T) has swept through the world, fundamentally changing the global economic structure and the way we live and consume. The application and omnipresence of communication technology, artificial intelligence and big data have not only spurred the birth of many new industries that operate across industries, sectors and geographical areas, as well as the emergence of the sharing economy, but also revolutionised the traditional and capital intensive business model based on tangible assets. They have generated keen competition along with opportunities for transformation. New technologies facilitate business start-up and foster new ideas, innovative products and services that generate economic benefits. This explains why major economies over the world all strive to develop I&T and regard it as the new driver of economic growth. To stay ahead of the game, we must enhance our I&T environment, attract companies from new economy sectors and research institutions to set up their presence in Hong Kong and nurture talent for a knowledge-based economy.', ""10.Second, the shift in global economic gravity from West to East is now established. Over the past five years, China has contributed over 30 per cent to the global economic growth and, together with other developing regions in Asia, has made up a share of almost 60 per cent. In the foreseeable future, the developing regions in Asia will continue to drive the global economy. Since the reform and opening up of our country four decades ago, China's economy grew by about 9.5 per cent per annum in real terms on average, and has risen to a US$12 trillion economy last year. Its per capita GDP also increased from just about US$200 in 1978 to over US$8,000 today. The future directions and strategies of our country's economic development have a major global bearing. They are also the linchpin of Hong Kong's sustained prosperity."", '11.Third, since the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008, there have been incessant protests against free trade and calls for de-globalisation in some advanced economies. Protectionism is also on the rise. The multilateral trade system advocated by the World Trade Organization over the past few decades has encountered enormous challenges. More economies have turned to regional or bilateral trade negotiations for promoting and maintaining their trading activities. While safeguarding multilateral trade, Hong Kong must also strive to conclude more regional and bilateral trade agreements.']"
3,Seizing Opportunities,"['Seizing Opportunities', '12.In response to the three major trends just mentioned, Hong Kong needs to consolidate and build on its existing strengths, rise with the tide and seize the opportunities before us.', ""13.In the Dedicated Chapter on Hong Kong and Macao in the 13th Five-Year Plan, our country indicates support for Hong Kong to leverage its unique advantages, reinforce and enhance its status as an international financial, transportation and trade centre, and strengthen Hong Kong's status as a global hub for off-shore Renminbi (RMB) business and our role as an international asset management centre, and move various services up the value chain. It also expresses support for Hong Kong in developing the I&T industry and establishing itself as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region."", '14.As stated in the report to the 19th CPC National Congress, the national economy has been transforming from a phase of rapid growth to high-quality development, and China will continue to forge ahead with consumption upgrading and the supply-side structural reform. The report also proposed to pursue the Belt and Road Initiative as a priority and give equal emphasis to ""bringing in"" and ""going global"", with a view to boosting two-way investment and trade flows between China and other countries, thus making new ground for opening up on all fronts. Moreover, the report advocated the implementation of a co-ordinated regional development strategy, including the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (Bay Area). On the other hand, the report pointed out the importance of forestalling and resolving major risks, especially the financial risks.', '15.The direction and strategies of China\'s economic development have created enormous opportunities for Hong Kong. Take the financial services industry as an example. With the unique advantage of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong has become the premier listing and fund-raising platform for Mainland enterprises and the global centre for off-shore RMB business. We have been contributing to our country\'s financial reforms and RMB internationalisation in a risk controlled manner. We have also played an unparalleled role in connecting the Mainland and the international markets and investors, and achieved significant development in the process.', '16.Looking ahead, our financial services industry will have ample room for more diversified development. We will map out a development blueprint for it.', ""17.Hong Kong's trade volume is four times its gross economic volume, and free trade is the cornerstone of our economy. We have all along been fostering economic development by expanding the boundaries and scale of our market. In the face of rising trade protectionism and anti-globalisation sentiments, the Belt and Road Initiative and the Bay Area development serve to enlarge the hinterland for business development of our enterprises and expand our market coverage."", 'Belt and Road Initiative', '18.The Belt and Road Initiative spans from east to west, covering both land and sea routes. By effectively improving the flow of people, goods and capital through facilities connectivity and policy co-ordination, the initiative will generate great demand for infrastructure, capital, as well as professional, legal and other high-end services over which Hong Kong has advantages. Supporting the Belt and Road development and assisting Mainland enterprises in going global will open up new room for the development of our enterprises as well as financial and professional services.', 'Bay Area', '19.The Bay Area development is of strategic significance to Hong Kong in three key aspects, namely, ""two markets"", ""I&T industries"" and ""land resources"".', '20.With a population of 68 million and GDP amounting to US$1,400 billion, the Bay Area is an enormous market for our financial and high-end services industries. Furthermore, as Hong Kong is the most cosmopolitan city offering the best professional services in the region, our enterprises and those in the Mainland may join forces in tapping new markets.', '21.The Bay Area covers not only Shenzhen which houses many leading I&T enterprises, but also a large number of cities transforming towards an advanced manufacturing economy. As such, the Bay Area and Hong Kong can complement each other in the field of I&T industries, thereby creating an international innovation and technology hub where talent, research and development (R&D) institutes and enterprises cluster.', '22.The Bay Area has abundant room for development as well as rich land resources. Upon the completion and commissioning of various transport infrastructure projects, travel within the Bay Area will be very convenient. With policy breakthroughs, it would offer more convenience to Hong Kong people who operate business, study, work and live in the Bay Area.']"
4,Rising to Challenges,"['Rising to Challenges', '23.To seize the opportunities, we must look squarely into the problems of land and manpower, which have been hindering the economic and social development of Hong Kong.', 'Land Supply', ""24. Hong Kong has been plagued by land shortage for years. The problem not only affects people's livelihood, but also restrains our growth potential. We must proactively address this problem with firm resolve. The Task Force on Land Supply established last year is striving to forge a consensus in the community on this issue."", 'Human Capital', '25.Furthermore, a shortage of workforce and talent has also impeded the economic development and competitiveness of Hong Kong.', ""26.The latest unemployment rate of below three per cent reflects a tight labour market in Hong Kong. With a rapidly ageing population, our workforce will fall from its peak in the coming few years. On the premise that local workers' priority for employment will be safeguarded, we should consider increasing imported labour in a timely manner and on an appropriate scale to address the specific needs of individual sectors."", '27.The Commission for the Planning of Human Resources led by the Chief Secretary for Administration will commence operation shortly. Fostering collaboration across bureaux and various sectors, the Commission will examine and co-ordinate existing policies and measures from a macro perspective.', '28.In parallel, the Government will continue to invest in education, training and retraining to enhance the quality and competitiveness of our workforce. In order to cater for the development needs of various sectors and industries, we will also enhance our talent admission arrangements to attract talent from outside Hong Kong. The Labour and Welfare Bureau is finalising the talent list, which is scheduled for completion in mid-2018.', 'Building Consensus', '29.The land and manpower problems in Hong Kong cannot be solved with financial resources alone. We should not shy away from the different voices in the community. Instead, in the spirit of ""seeking common ground while shelving major differences"", we should build consensus in a pragmatic and rational manner, and join hands to overcome constraints. While there are vast opportunities for Hong Kong\'s development, they do not knock twice or wait for anyone. We have to stay united and seize each and every opportunity.']"
5,The Government's Role,"[""The Government's Role"", '30.Our free and highly efficient market has won worldwide acclaim. Under normal circumstances, the market is the most efficient mechanism to allocate resources. One should therefore respect market forces when formulating economic policies.', '31.That said, with the upsurge of I&T and fierce competition between economies, the current-term Government will examine Hong Kong\'s competitiveness, our economy as well as the current state and direction for development of our industries from a forward-looking and strategic perspective. Playing the role as a ""facilitator"" and a ""promoter"", we will introduce timely and appropriate measures to support industries where we have strengths and development potentials, and tap new markets. We will also review regulatory and tax requirements to remove red tape and create a business-friendly environment. Our various initiatives in promoting I&T and financial development are some examples.', '32.The Government will focus in particular on removing land and manpower constraints. At the same time, we will maintain a simple and competitive tax regime as well as a transparent and efficient regulatory system, while encouraging investment and innovation. Under the present macro environment in which opportunities abound, I am confident that we can find more drivers for growth to support the development of our society.', '33.Now, let us review our economic performance over the past year.']"
6,EconomicSituation in 2017,"['EconomicSituation in 2017', ""34.Throughout 2017, the global economic landscape continued to improve. The economies of the US, Eurozone and Japan recovered further with a synchronised acceleration of growth. The Mainland economy, sustaining strong growth momentum at 6.9 per cent, bolstered regional trade flows in Asia. Hong Kong's exports of goods registered appreciable growth of 5.9 per cent in real terms. Exports of services also returned to a steady growth of 3.5 per cent in real terms."", '35.Domestic demand remained particularly resilient. Full employment, coupled with the positive wealth effect, drove strong consumer confidence. Last year, private consumption expenditure grew by 5.4 per cent in real terms, the fastest since 2011. Investment expenditure also increased by 4.2 per cent in real terms for the year.', ""36.Overall, due to the better-than-expected outturn in the external environment, Hong Kong's economy grew by 3.8 per cent last year, higher than the forecast in last year's Budget and the average trend growth rate of 2.9 per cent over the decade from 2007 to 2016."", ""37.In a state of full employment, the labour market further tightened in the latter half of the year. The latest unemployment rate dropped to a 20-year low of 2.9 per cent. Strong economic growth spurred a gradual increase in employment during the year, with broad-based improvement in wages and earnings in real terms. The headline inflation rate for 2017 was 1.5 per cent, as inflationary pressure remained moderate. Netting out the effects of the Government's one-off measures, the underlying inflation rate was 1.7 per cent in 2017, the sixth consecutive year of easing.""]"
7,EconomicProspects for 2018 and Medium-term Outlook,"['EconomicProspects for 2018 and Medium-term Outlook', '38.Looking ahead, I am cautiously optimistic. The global economy remains on an upward trend, with a synchronised upturn in major economies. The International Monetary Fund lately forecast that the global economic growth this year should reach 3.9 per cent, the fastest since 2011. Yet, we need to remain alert to changes in the global monetary environment and geopolitical situations, as well as policy risks of major economies.', '39.The performance of the US economy last year exceeded expectation, with unemployment rate falling below the levels before the financial tsunami. As the US implemented a tax reform at the end of last year, we need to continue monitoring its potential impact on the US and global economy, as well as the capital flows worldwide. The pace of monetary policy normalisation of the Federal Reserve is another major factor affecting the global economic and monetary environment this year.', '40.The recovery momentum in the Eurozone becomes more entrenched as the unemployment rate continues to fall. The policy moves by the European Central Bank following its tapering of monthly asset purchases early this year and the progress of Brexit negotiations deserve attention.', '41.In the Mainland, as it deepens the supply-side structural reform to promote economic upgrading and transformation, and continues to prevent and control financial risks, it is expected to maintain a medium-high rate of economic growth and remain the main engine of global economic growth this year.', ""42.All in all, the prevailing external environment is promising. The expected gradual pick-up in demand from major economies will lead to considerable growth in Asian exports. Hong Kong's exports of goods should be able to grow steadily. If the recovery of tourism in recent months can be sustained, Hong Kong's retail sector will also see a more vibrant performance."", '43.Our favourable employment and income conditions will spur consumption growth in Hong Kong this year. Sanguine local economic sentiment and positive business confidence should also sustain investment growth. In the light of the global and local economic situations at this juncture, I forecast economic growth of three to four per cent for Hong Kong this year.', '44.On inflation, local cost pressures will go up somewhat amid sustained economic growth. Imported inflation will also edge up alongside the global economic upturn, but such pressure is unlikely to be high. Overall, inflation will remain moderate this year. For 2018 as a whole, I forecast that the headline inflation rate will be 2.2 per cent with an underlying inflation rate at 2.5 per cent.', '45.Since the start of this year, the expectation of a US interest rates adjustment has triggered substantial fluctuations in the global financial markets. I urge all investors to stay vigilant. As always, the Government is committed to ensuring an orderly and steady operation of our financial system.', '46.Over the past few years, with a tight supply of residential flats, ultra-low interest rates and an influx of capital, property prices have soared beyond the affordability of ordinary citizens. However, I believe that the key factors underpinning soaring property prices over the past few years are gradually undergoing fundamental changes. First, the supply of residential flats will increase. The private sector will, on average, produce about 20 800 residential units annually in the coming five years (from 2018 to 2022), an increase of 50 per cent over the annual average in the past five years. Besides, as at end-December 2017, the projected supply from the first-hand private residential property market in the next three to four years will remain at a high level of approximately 97 000 units. We anticipate that the tight supply situation in the property market will ease. Besides, as the US interest rate normalisation process continues, the ultra-low interest rate environment of the past few years will no longer persist. The changes in these key factors will put pressure on the property market. The Government will keep a close watch over changes in the property market. Before making a home purchase decision, the public should carefully assess the risks involved, especially the impact of interest rate hikes on their ability to repay.']"
8,Public Finances,"['Public Finances', 'New Fiscal Philosophy', ""47.The Chief Executive has put forward a new fiscal philosophy for the current-term Government. It envisages that on the premise of ensuring the health of our public finance, the Government should adopt forward-looking and strategic financial management principles in optimising the use of surplus to invest for Hong Kong and relieve our people's burdens. I agree entirely with her view."", '48.In formulating fiscal policies, we should strive to be innovative, responding to community aspirations promptly and effectively and making a head start to foster long-term development.']"
9,Budget Strategies for 2018-19,"['Budget Strategies for 2018-19', ""49.In preparing this year's Budget, I have ensured that adequate resources are provided to implement the various policy initiatives put forth in the Policy Address. I have also adopted the following strategies:"", '50.I now turn to three issues on public finances which were frequently raised during the consultation exercise.', 'Annual Surplus', '51.It is expected that the Government will have an estimated surplus of $138 billion in 2017-18. As pointed out in my Budget last year, when considering how our annual surplus is to be deployed, I will carefully take into account the source and nature of the surplus, and make optimal allocation of resources in the light of the external and local economic environment, social needs and public expectations. This year, I will follow the same principle by sharing with the community about 40 per cent of the projected annual surplus, and using the remaining for improving services and investing in the future.', 'Fiscal Reserves', ""52.We have a healthy fiscal surplus, but as a small and highly open economy, Hong Kong is susceptible to changes in the external economic environment. The linked exchange rate system leaves us limited room to adjust our monetary policy. Therefore, healthy public finances are vital for Hong Kong as they enable us not only to accelerate our development and expand our capacity when the economy is stable, but also to introduce counter-cyclical measures promptly and effectively in times of economic downturn, thereby stabilising the economy and safeguarding people's livelihood."", '53.As we all know, Hong Kong has a narrow tax base, and our revenue sources are concentrated. In 2017-18, profits tax, salaries tax, stamp duties and land premium account for about 74 per cent of total government revenue. Among them, land premium and stamp duties fluctuate the most and they account for 27 per cent and 15 per cent of our total revenue respectively.', '54.Fiscal surpluses in recent years were attributable mainly to the buoyancy of asset markets. However, experience shows that asset markets can be highly volatile and any downturn will put our revenue and fiscal position under pressure.', '55.When considering the allocation of resources, I often remind myself to take a more forward-looking perspective. To better care for people in need, the Government has implemented measures proactively for elderly care and support for the disadvantaged over the past few years. In the face of a rapidly ageing population and fierce competitions from other economies, we need to enhance our economic structure, strengthen healthcare and elderly services, nurture talent, increase land supply and housing, improve labour welfare, and build a caring and just society. These are significant commitments.', '56.Moreover, the Budget is prepared on a cash basis and mainly reflects the projected cash receipts and disbursements of the new financial year with forecasts for the following four years. It does not fully reflect our liabilities and committed expenditure, such as the outstanding commitment of over $350 billion for ongoing works projects. Besides, the financial implications of policy initiatives may not be fully reflected in the Budget of the new financial year because of the lead time required for implementation.', 'Relationship between Public Expenditureand GDP', '57.In the past, it was a budgetary criterion that public expenditure should be kept at or below 20 per cent of GDP. One of the considerations was to avoid over-expansion of the Government, which might not be conducive to resource deployment. Today, while acknowledging the forces and roles of the market, we have to be more proactive in managing public finances in the face of various development needs of society and the economy. During the period between the 2018-19 Budget and the subsequent years in the Medium Range Forecast, the public expenditure will be slightly higher than 21 per cent of our GDP, but I will ensure that the increase in public expenditure is necessary to meet the actual needs of Hong Kong, and broadly in line with our affordability in the long run.', '(a)proactively promoting economic development by providing favourable conditions for emerging industries such as I&T and identifying growth opportunities on the one hand, and strengthening the competitiveness of the pillar industries on the other, so that our economy will prosper in a sustained and diversified manner, creating quality jobs for our young people;(b)making bold investments to break through the development bottlenecks. The Budget will optimise the use of surplus to build capacity in terms of land and human capital;', ""(c)improving the existing services and quality of life;(d)preparing to meet the community's long-term needs for healthcare and elderly care;(e)while maintaining the competitiveness of our tax regime, making suitable adjustments to ease the burden on taxpayers and enterprises, having regard to our prevailing fiscal position;(f)caring for and sharing with the community by enhancing support for the disadvantaged and enabling members of the public to enjoy the fruits of our economic success; and(g)maintaining adequate fiscal reserves.""]"
10,Revised Estimates for 2017-18,"['Revised Estimates for 2017-18', '58.The 2017-18 revised estimate on government revenue is $612.4 billion, 20.6 per cent or $104.7 billion higher than the original estimate. This is due mainly to much higher-than-expected revenues from land premium and stamp duties.', '59.The revenue arising from the sale of several residential and commercial sites in the urban area and a sharp increase in the number of land exchange agreements concluded with developers, land premium increases by $62.6 billion to $163.6 billion or 62 per cent higher than the original estimate. As a result of heated trading in both the property and stock markets last year, the revenue arising from stamp duties would be $39.7 billion or 75 per cent higher than estimated, reaching $92.7 billion.', '60.As for government expenditure, I forecast a revised estimate of $474.4 billion, 3.5 per cent or $17 billion lower than the original estimate. This is mainly because the expenditure on certain initiatives, such as the Old Age Living Allowance (OALA) and the Low-income Working Family Allowance (LIFA), were lower than the original estimate.', '61.For 2017-18, I forecast a surplus of $138 billion. Fiscal reserves are expected to reach $1,092 billion by 31 March 2018 while the Housing Reserve will reach $78.8 billion.']"

12,Innovation and Technology,"['Innovation and Technology', '63.I&T is undoubtedly an economic driver in the new era.', ""64.To shine in the fierce I&T race amidst keen competition, Hong Kong must optimise its resources by focusing on developing its areas of strength, namely biotechnology, artificial intelligence, smart city and financial technologies (Fintech), and forge ahead according to the eight major directions set out by the Chief Executive. In order to achieve results, our targeted efforts must be underpinned by adequate resources.  In last year's Budget, I reserved $10 billion for supporting I&T development. This year, I will set aside an additional $50 billion."", 'Lok Ma Chau Loop', '65.Of this, $20 billion will be used on the first phase of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park in the Lok Ma Chau Loop for, inter alia, site formation, infrastructure, superstructure and initial operation. Given the scale of the development, it is estimated that the whole project will eventually cost far more than $20 billion. When the relevant planning studies are finished, we will make reference to the findings and provide additional resources in a timely manner so that the Park can come into operation as early as possible.', 'Innovation and Technology Fund', ""66.Besides, we will inject $10 billion into the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF). The ITF's financial support for I&T development in Hong Kong has increased from about $700 million in 2013-14 to $1.5 billion in 2017-18. It is anticipated that the demand for funds will continue to increase. As our fiscal position is strong this year, I believe that a funding injection is opportune. The ITF will continue to support applied R&D work in Hong Kong with the additional resources."", 'Establishing Technology Research Clusters', ""67.I will also earmark $10 billion to support the establishment of two research clusters on healthcare technologies and on artificial intelligence and robotics technologies, to attract the world's top scientific research institutions and technology enterprises to Hong Kong for conducting more midstream and downstream R&D projects in collaboration with local universities and scientific research institutions. Such clusters will pool and nurture more technology talent in Hong Kong. I will provide financial support for non-profit-making scientific research institutions that will establish their presence in these two clusters."", 'Science Park', ""68.To reinforce the role of the Science Park as Hong Kong's flagship technology infrastructure, I will allocate $10 billion to the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC).

Cyberport is going to launch an ""easy landing"" programme to attract multinational companies (including overseas and Mainland leading internet enterprises and Fintech companies) to set up offices and R&D units in Hong Kong. It will also roll out a new support scheme, offering financial assistance up to $200,000 for each eligible start-up to conduct market research and promotion, as well as participate in business missions, trade fairs and exhibitions, etc. outside Hong Kong. The financial assistance offered under Cyberport\'s incubation programme to individual start-ups will also increase by 50 per cent to $500,000.', 'E-sports', '70.In recent years, e-sports have been developing rapidly with tremendous potential. Last December, Cyberport completed a study on the promotion of e-sports in Hong Kong and made a number of recommendations. To promote the development of e-sports, I will allocate $100 million to Cyberport. The Cyberport Arcade will become a local e-sports and digital entertainment node providing a competition venue for e-sports. Support will also be provided for the e-sports sector in areas such as technological development and talent nurturing.', 'Encouraging Research and Development', '71.To encourage R&D, the Chief Executive announced in her Policy Address the provision of additional tax deduction for domestic expenditure on R&D incurred by enterprises. Enterprises will enjoy a 300 per cent tax deduction for the first $2 million qualifying R&D expenditure, and a 200 per cent deduction for the remainder. Drafting of the legislation and consultation have already commenced.', 'Promoting ""Re-industrialisation""', '72.I set up the Committee on Innovation, Technology and Re-industrialisation last April to promote re-industrialisation. The Data Technology Hub and the Advanced Manufacturing Centre under construction are expected to be completed in 2020 and 2022 respectively. We are also expanding the Science Park, which is expected to provide extra space for start-ups and other technology companies in two years. Moreover, the Hong Kong Productivity Council established an Inno Space last October to provide working space and technical support for start-ups, students and graduates to help them develop their innovative ideas into industrial design, which may subsequently be translated into products through prototyping.', 'Technology Voucher Programme', '73.In addition to the above new initiatives, the Government will also relax the eligibility criteria for the Technology Voucher Programme.

We expect that the Asian bond markets will continue to expand. To encourage more investors and issuers from the Mainland, Asia and along the Belt and Road to participate in the Hong Kong bond market, the Government plans to launch an array of measures to enhance our competitiveness, including attracting corporate bond issuance, facilitating investors participation and broadening investment platform.', 'Pilot Bond Grant Scheme', '80.First, I propose to launch a three-year Pilot Bond Grant Scheme to attract local, Mainland and overseas enterprises to issue bonds in Hong Kong. The pilot scheme will cover eligible enterprises issuing bonds in Hong Kong for the first time. The amount of grant for each bond issuance is equivalent to half of the issue expenses, capped at HK$2.5 million. Each enterprise can apply for a grant for two bond issuances at most. The HKMA will announce the details in due course.', 'Qualifying Debt Instrument Scheme', '81.I also propose to amend the qualifying debt instrument scheme by increasing the types of qualified instruments. In addition to instruments lodged and cleared by the Central Moneymarkets Unit of the HKMA, debt securities listed on the SEHK will also become eligible. We will also extend the scope of tax exemption from debt instruments with an original maturity of not less than seven years to instruments of any duration. Under the enhanced scheme, Hong Kong investors will enjoy tax concession for interest income and trading profits derived from a more diverse range of debt instruments.', 'Government Bond Programme', '82.On developing retail bonds, I propose to continue the issuance of Silver Bonds in 2018 and 2019, targeting Hong Kong residents aged 65 or above.', 'Green Bond and Green Finance', ""83.To demonstrate the Government's commitment to promoting green finance, I propose to launch a green bond issuance programme with a borrowing ceiling of $100 billion.
