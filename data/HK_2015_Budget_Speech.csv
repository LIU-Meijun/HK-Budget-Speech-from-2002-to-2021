0,[Introduction],"['Mr President,', ' I move that the Appropriation Bill 2015 be read a second time.', '2.Today is the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, our common birthday in the Chinese tradition. May I wish you, Mr President, Members and fellow citizens good health and happiness in the Year of the Ram.', '3.2014 was an extraordinary year for all of us. Momentous events, local and global, changed the lives of many and transformed our city. Events are still unfolding, and will require our close scrutiny. But, one thing is for sure – a totally different environment has emerged which presents new challenges ahead.', '4.Since the start of 2015, the international political arena and global financial markets have provided plenty of breaking news. The launch of quantitative easing by Europe and Japan has increased global liquidity. On top of heightened geopolitical tensions in a number of regions, terrorism has added further uncertainty and once again rattled the nerves of the international community. Locally, with constitutional reform entering the next stage, we anticipate that disputes, both inside and outside the Council, will become even more vehement this year.', '5.The long drawn out unlawful occupy movement disrupted different facets of the city to varying degrees. The serious divisions in society that emerged during the 79 days has not only affected the image of Hong Kong, but also aroused concern about much more radical social conflict which in turn will make it harder to mend conflicted relationships among people.', '6.Without doubt, the social issues revealed during the incident did not come about, nor can they be resolved, overnight. We should seek to narrow our differences and pursue consensus with patience and pragmatism. Prolonged bickering will only bog down our development.', '7.I am glad to see that most people do care dearly for our home, Hong Kong. People do cherish our fine tradition of the rule of law, and do not want to see our well-developed systems eroded. Diversity, openness, peace and freedom are not only our core values, but also the foundations of our success, and the most reliable co-ordinates of our development path. If we can firmly grasp these fundamentals, we shall be more confident charting our way forward.', ""8.This year's Budget will complement the initiatives announced in the Policy Address and address the constraints on land and manpower through the effective use of resources. We seek to reinforce the foundation for long-term economic development. In addition to capitalising on our strengths, I shall explore new ideas and strive for diversity to help members of the community realise their aspirations. In particular, I shall make the best use of resources generated by the community's efforts, and continue to care for the disadvantaged and promote sustainable development, so that people from different sectors as well as our next generations can share the benefits of economic growth.""]"
1,[Economic Performance in 2014],"[""9.Global economic performance was less than spectacular in 2014. Despite the steady performance of the Mainland's economy and signs of recovery in the US, our trade performance was beset by Eurozone's weakening economy and Japan's relapse into recession. Merchandise exports grew by one per cent and service exports by 0.5 per cent in real terms. As a result, our economy grew by only 2.3 per cent last year, the third consecutive year with a growth rate lower than the annual average of 3.9 per cent over the past decade."", '10.The unemployment rate averaged at a low level of 3.2 per cent for the year as a whole, sustaining a state of full employment. Private consumption expenditure maintained moderate growth, but investment expenditure was soft and sentiment turned cautious.', ""11.Inflation continued to ease. Overall rentals rose, but the rises were generally modest. With steady increases in labour costs and mild imported inflation, the headline inflation rate for 2014 was 4.4 per cent. Netting out the effects of Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate was 3.5 per cent, lower than the four per cent in 2013."", ""12.Prolonged political bickering is detrimental to public administration and the international image of Hong Kong as a stable, law-abiding and efficient city. It may even dampen investors' confidence in Hong Kong. Such self-inflicted harm does not serve the city well. The occupy movement affected tourism, hotel, catering, retail and transport industries, etc. to varying degrees. To offset the impact on economic confidence, I shall implement an array of support measures targeting affected industries and launch a new round of efforts to promote Hong Kong.""]"
2,[Targeted Support    Measures],"['13.I shall launch the following short-term measures to support the affected sectors –', '(a)waive the licence fees for 1800 travel agents for six months;', '(b)waive the licence fees for 2000 hotels and guesthouses for six months;', '(c)waive the licence fees for restaurants and hawkers and fees for restricted food permits for six months, benefiting 26000 restaurants and operators in total; and', '(d)waive the fees for vehicle examination once for the renewal of vehicle licences of taxis, light buses, franchised and non-franchised buses, goods vehicles, trailers and special purpose vehicles within a year.']"
3,[Rebuilding    Confidence],"[""14.More importantly, we need to rebuild international investors' and tourists' confidence in Hong Kong and uplift our international image. Starting from January, the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) has launched a new round of publicity in Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia and major Mainland cities."", ""15.I shall allocate an additional $80 million for HKTB to step up its promotion efforts in the coming year. These activities will include running overseas promotions, organising shopping festivals and offering merchandise concessions and electronic discount coupons in collaboration with the retail industry, and arranging large-scale familiarisation tours to Hong Kong for overseas trade missions. HKTB will expand the scale of overseas promotion fairs this year and waive local traders' participation fees."", '16.I shall also allocate an additional $26 million to the Information Services Department for inviting overseas media organisations and opinion leaders from around the world to visit Hong Kong, arranging for more overseas visits, and launching another round of publicity campaign for Brand Hong Kong. The Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), Hong Kong Trade Development Council and Hong Kong representation overseas, and in the Mainland and Taiwan will also organise promotional activities.', ""17.This series of support measures and promotion efforts, costing $290 million, will render the affected sectors some tangible assistance, help rebuild confidence in Hong Kong, and enhance the city's image.""]"
4,[Economic Outlook for 2015],"['18.The year 2015 will be a challenging year. Amid improvement in the US economy, the US Federal Reserve Board is preparing to raise interest rates, running counter to the further easing measures pursued by the central banks of Europe and Japan. The stance of the new Greek government has added uncertainties to the market.', '19.The drop in international oil prices is beneficial to Hong Kong and other net energy importers. Excessive oil price volatility, however, will pose a real threat to the global economy and financial markets.', '20.The interaction of these factors will further complicate the external environment: (a) the US inflation outlook will be affected, making it more difficult to forecast the pace of interest rate rise; (b) rising deflation risks in Europe and Japan will add headwinds to the economic recovery; and (c) some oil exporting countries face huge pressures on finance and exchange rates due to geopolitical tensions and dropping oil prices. All these macroeconomic factors will upset the stability of global financial markets.', ""21.Emerging Asian markets are showing a better performance in general. The Mainland's economic growth is relatively stable but faces downward pressure this year. The global economy as a whole is likely to stay on a slow-growing path in the post-financial tsunami period. This, amid a stronger US dollar, will continue to put a drag on Hong Kong's trade performance."", '22.Domestically, local consumption and investment sentiment will be dampened by the increased uncertainties over the US interest rate hike and weaker spending power of inbound visitors. In the face of internal and external challenges, I forecast Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at one to three per cent in 2015.', '23.The labour market will hold largely stable. But if the domestic sector continues to be trapped in a slow-growing path, the pace of job creation by enterprises will be affected.', '24.As regards inflation, with the softening of global commodity prices in the past year, imported inflation will remain mild. Retail sales have weakened recently, and rental pressure is less than that in previous years. I forecast that the headline inflation rate for 2015 as a whole will be 3.5 per cent with an underlying inflation rate at three per cent.']"
5,[Support for Small and Medium Enterprises],"[""25.Our external trade performance will be affected by a host of uncertainties this year. It can hardly drive our economic growth. As such, we shall need to rely on domestic demand for maintaining economic vibrancy and preserving employment. There are 320 000 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Hong Kong, accounting for 98 per cent of the total local enterprises and employing 50 per cent of the private sector workforce. This underscores SMEs' role as the mainstay of our economy. To support SMEs, I shall –"", '(a)extend the application period for the special concessionary measures under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme to 29February2016;', '(b)inject $1.5billion into the SME Export Marketing and Development Funds;', '(c)increase the maximum amount of funding support for each project under the SME Development Fund from $2million to $5million; and', '(d)expand the scope of the SME Export Marketing Fund.']"
6,[Relief Measures],"[""26.I am aware that many of our citizens are expecting relief measures from Government to allay their burdens. In view of the challenging international macroeconomic environment, the unstable economic factors, the need to boost the local economy in the short term, and Government's relatively sound fiscal position in the short to medium term, I shall increase public expenditure in a prudent manner according to the principle of committing resources as and when justified and needed, and introduce the following one-off relief measures –"", '27.I have to point out that recurrent measures and one-off measures serve different objectives and purposes. The former addresses recurrent needs of the community, while the latter serves counter-cyclical objectives to provide cushioning effects for the economy and alleviate imminent economic hardships. They are not interchangeable.', '28.I raised the child allowances for three consecutive years from 2011-12 to 2013-14. Many parents want Government to provide more specific tax exemptions to ease their burden in taking care of their children. I understand the problems they are facing, but we need also to avoid complicating the tax regime. I shall increase the basic and additional child allowances from $70,000 to $100,000 from 2015-16 onwards. This will reduce government revenue by $2 billion each year.', '29.Amounting to $34 billion, the six relief measures above should help alleviate the financial burden on the public, stimulate consumption, stabilise the economy and preserve employment. Together with other measures in the Budget, they will have a fiscal stimulus effect of boosting GDP by one percentage point.', '(a)reduce salaries tax and tax under personal assessment for 2014-15 by 75percent, subject to a ceiling of $20,000. The reduction will be reflected in the final tax payable for 2014-15. This proposal will benefit 1.82million taxpayers in the territory and reduce government revenue by $15.8billion;', '(b)reduce profits tax for 2014-15 by 75percent, subject to a ceiling of $20,000. The reduction will be reflected in the final tax payable for 2014-15. This proposal will benefit 130000 taxpayers in the territory and reduce government revenue by $1.9billion;', '(c)waive rates for the first two quarters of 2015-16, subject to a ceiling of $2,500per quarter for each rateable property. It will benefit 3.15million properties and reduce government revenue by $7.7billion;', '(d)provide an extra allowance to Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) recipients, equal to two months of the standard rate CSSA payments, and an extra allowance to the recipients of Old Age Allowance, Old Age Living Allowance and Disability Allowance, equal to two months of the respective allowances. This will involve an additional expenditure of $5.5billion; and', ""(e)pay one month's rent for lower income tenants living in the rental units of the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS). Involving an expenditure of $1.1billion, this measure will not apply to tenants who are required to pay additional rent to HKHA and non-elderly tenants of the HKHS GroupB estates.""]"
7,[Developing Our Economy],"[""30.My key mission as Financial Secretary is to maintain a favourable business environment, promote sustainable economic development, and make available diverse and quality jobs to enable citizens to lead better and more fulfilling lives. I must also ensure that Government has adequate resources to enhance social services and improve people's livelihood."", '31.Technologies have brought economic globalisation into a new phase. Competition between economies has never been so fierce as potential customers became more accessible to enterprises all over the world. Only the fittest will survive, a reality that local enterprises have to face.', ""32.This new norm enables enterprises to adopt modern modes of production led by global supply chains and choose the most competitive partners from around the world. With Hong Kong's established position as an international financial, trading and logistics hub, our commercial sector is accustomed to utilising supply chain management. This gives them the opportunity to benefit from the ample room for development brought about by the close connections between regions."", '33.In the face of such challenges and opportunities, we should seek to lay a solid foundation for long-term development in a pragmatic manner, and enhance our overall strengths step by step through adding value to traditional industries and developing diversified new industries.', '34.Manpower mismatch is becoming more and more evident in Hong Kong in recent years. This, coupled with the imminent challenge of an ageing population, has directly hindered the sustainable economic development of our city. We must strive to overcome the constraints on our development potential and rise to the challenges together. Otherwise, our next generations will have to bear the price of our short-sightedness.']"
8,[Diversified Development],"['35.Hong Kong has long been a cradle for entrepreneurs. The city is renowned for its favourable business environment, with a fair and transparent market system, a liberal and open investment climate, and a simple and low tax regime. Legends of rags to riches live on for generations. Many entrepreneurs started their business without much experience, technology or capital. But their flexibility and market acumen have opened up new opportunities in different trades and markets.', '36.Social enterprises are gaining recognition in Hong Kong. With business models that balance economic and other social values, they mark the maturing of our society. Research showed that each dollar of public funding contributed four to seven dollars of workfare to those disadvantaged employees, reflecting the significant benefits brought about by social enterprises.', ""37.Diversified and dynamic, Hong Kong boasts a melting pot of cultures with a blooming talent pool in the cultural and creative sectors. I shall take the fashion industry, the film industry and the arts and culture sector as examples to unveil Government's initiatives in promoting these industries.""]"
9,[Start-ups],"['38.A new wave of entrepreneurship, in the form of start-ups, is emerging around the world. Many start-ups boldly apply new technologies, information technology in particular, disrupting the traditional mode of operation. They translate state-of-the-art technologies into competitive products and services that change consumption patterns and open up new markets.', '39.Last few years saw a notable burgeoning of start-ups in Hong Kong. They managed to build up a wider clientele base by conducting in-depth market studies, over and above their clearly-defined positioning and inspiring marketing strategies. I have seen an enterprise developing wireless chargers for electronic devices, and another designing a mobile application for pre-ordering coffee.', '40.Hong Kong is among the most advanced information and communication technology hubs in the world. Our well-established business support services and sound system to protect intellectual property (IP) rights provide favourable conditions for the growth of start-ups. Many public and private organisations offer support, including provision of co-working space, incubation programmes, business advisory services, and assistance in building partner networks. The number of such organisations has increased by tenfold over the past three years, and they include world-renowned organisations such as Nest and Accenture.', '41.InvestHK launched a large promotion campaign known as ""StartmeupHK"" two years ago to promote our advantages as a leading global hub for start-ups. The campaign has attracted innovative start-ups with potential to our city, and brought Hong Kong-based enterprises to the attention of many international angel and venture capital investors.', '42.We have witnessed a growing interest amongst investors in Hong Kong start-ups. International IT giants such as Microsoft have set up offices here to look for new businesses that are worth investing in. Start-ups nurtured by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC) and the Cyberport have also attracted hundreds of millions of dollars of investment.', '43.Financing needs increase as start-ups grow. To further encourage financing of new enterprises, HKSTPC will earmark $50 million to set up a corporate venture fund for co-investment, on a matching basis with private funds, in start-ups which are located in the Science Park or have participated in its incubation programmes. I shall also ask the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (HKMC) to expand and enhance the Microfinance Scheme.', '44.In addition, the proposed injection of $5 billion to the Innovation and Technology Fund will help strengthen support for relevant enterprises.', '45.We strive to provide start-ups with enhanced hardware and software support. HKSTPC will extend the Leading Enterprises Acceleration Programme to help more companies with potential to consolidate their businesses, raise capital and improve corporate management.', '46.From this year onwards, free online government information will be released in digital formats to encourage development of more applications by start-ups. Many start-ups have developed a wide range of mobile applications by exploiting such public sector information, including information on real-time traffic and weather conditions.', '47.Financial technologies are also an investment target of many venture capitalists or crowd funding efforts. Financial technologies that help facilitate functions such as payment, clearing and settlement systems, big data analytics, cloud computing, information and risk management and network security can enhance operational efficiency and help open new modes of development for the financial sector. Being an international financial centre with years of experience in technology, Hong Kong is an ideal place for developing financial technologies. I have asked the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury to set up a steering group to study how to develop Hong Kong into a financial technology hub together with industries, research and development institutions as well as regulatory authorities.', '48.I hope to improve the ecosystem for local start-ups and technological enterprises to tie in with the general direction of moving our economy up the value chain and enabling local industries to diversify.']"
10,[Social Enterprises],"['49.With the relentless and concerted efforts of Government and various sectors over the years, local social enterprises have attained solid growth. Their scope of services and target clients have become more diversified, earning wider recognition from the community. Apart from creating job opportunities, social enterprises also engage people from different sectors to serve the community. For instance, there are social enterprises renting domestic units to single-parent families with imminent housing need as co-tenants at below-market rates, offering barrier-free taxi services to wheelchair users, and operating restaurants to create jobs for women living in the same district.', '50.Since the launch of the Enhancing Self-Reliance Through District Partnership Programme (ESR Programme) in 2006, the Home Affairs Department has so far allocated a total of $180 million for the establishment of 161 social enterprises, which created 2 600 job opportunities. Eighty per cent of these social enterprises have become self-sustaining after the funding period.', '51.I shall earmark $150 million to roll out a new phase of the ESR Programme from 2016-17 to 2019-20, under which enhancement measures will be implemented to benefit more types of social enterprises and encourage greater participation of the commercial sector in the development of social enterprises.']"
11,[Cultural and Creative Industries],"['52.Government has been working closely with the cultural and creative industries to promote their development, with a view to creating an atmosphere that inspires creativity, and expanding the local market as well as exploring outside markets.', '53.I shall inject an additional $400 million into the CreateSmart Initiative to support different sectors of the creative industries. Efforts will be made to assist them to participate in and organise exhibitions and fairs, provide talented people with training programmes and subsidised overseas exchanges and internships so as to afford them opportunities to realise their potential.']"
12,[Fashion Industry],"[""54.Hong Kong's textiles and clothing industry has a solid foundation. Many famous fashion designers have had spectacular success in creating their own brands. The trade has been dedicated to grooming and nurturing talent. An organisation offers co-working space in an industrial building for promising fashion designers and introduces their designs to international markets. A long-established spinning mill plans to revitalise its old factory into an incubation centre for fashion designers and other related facilities. Promoting collaboration between fashion design and the clothing industry to move them up the value ladder will enable them to generate greater economic benefits."", ""55.I agree with the recommendations of the Economic Development Commission on promoting the development of the fashion industry. I shall consolidate the existing resources and invest new resources, totalling $500 million, to launch a series of measures on a pilot basis in the next three years. These include promoting Hong Kong's fashion designers and brands through improving local fashion events and participating in those held overseas, rolling out an incubation programme for up-and-coming fashion design start-ups, providing fashion design graduates with overseas internships and study opportunities, and subsidising participation in international competitions and exhibitions. We shall also set up an advisory body for the trade to advise on and co-ordinate the implementation of these measures.""]"
13,[Film Industry],"['56.The film industry has long been a key element of Hong Kong\'s creative industries. The vast Mainland market presents local filmmakers with unprecedented opportunities and big challenges. In recent years, Government has been supporting production of small-to-medium budget films through the Film Development Fund (FDF). Many of these films, such as ""Echoes of the Rainbow"", ""The Way We Dance"" and ""The Midnight After"", are critically-acclaimed box office hits with Hong Kong characteristics.', '57.I shall make a further injection of $200 million into FDF, enhance its funding arrangements and introduce a subsidy scheme for film productions with a budget not exceeding $10 million, subject to a subsidy ceiling of $2 million, to boost the volume of local film production and nurture film talent. I shall raise the production budget ceiling of the Scheme for Financing Film Production from $15 million to $25 million. To identify new talent for the film industry, Government will relaunch the First Feature Film Initiative with increased subsidies on production costs.']"
14,[Art and Culture],"[""58.We have seen a blossoming of local arts groups in recent years. Quite a number are emerging ones widely acclaimed for their high artistic attainments. This has not only enriched Hong Kong's cultural landscape by presenting the general public with more high quality performances and exhibitions, but also created more development opportunities for local artists and young people aspiring to pursue careers in the arts field."", '59.I shall launch a $300 million Art Development Matching Grants Pilot Scheme, under which the amount of private donation and sponsorship secured by eligible local arts groups will be matched by grants. It will encourage different sectors of the community to sponsor local art and cultural activities, and help sustain the development of the cultural industry, jazzing up the cultural aura of the city.', '60.These measures will offer a platform for Hong Kong people, the younger generation in particular, to actualise themselves and unleash their creativity. We should combine all these efforts to take our economy towards even greater diversity.']"
15,[Augmenting    Competitiveness],"[""61.With continuing economic reform for over three decades, China's remarkable achievements have been impressive. The success of Hong Kong's four pillar industries, namely trading and logistics, tourism, business and professional services and financial services, which are internationally competitive, is attributed not just to their innovation and upgrading efforts over past decades, but also to the economic development of the Mainland. We need to capitalise on today's opportunities to add value to our already competitive pillar industries, keep pace with the times and get ready for challenges, taking a role in fostering China's prosperity.""]"
16,["One Belt One Road"],"['62.The Central Government has put forward the initiatives of building the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, or ""One Belt One Road"" in short. These economic co-operation corridors, spanning different regions in Asia, Europe and Africa, will promote co-development among countries and foster co-operation in the political, economic and social areas. The initiatives feature ""five links"" in the arenas of policy, facilities, trade, capital and culture.', '63.Many countries along the ""One Belt One Road"" have great development potential. To strengthen trade ties with these markets, Hong Kong should expand co-operation, organise exchange visits, gain a deeper understanding of these countries, as well as pursue negotiations on Free Trade Agreements, Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements and Comprehensive Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements. Trade facilitation and investment promotion to secure business opportunities in various aspects should also be developed.', '64.Hong Kong can work with Mainland provinces and municipalities to stage roadshows in these countries to facilitate trade and investment flows for regional economic integration. This will create more favourable conditions for our goods, services and investment to access overseas markets.', '65.While the Mainland is further strengthening its economic and trade ties with countries along the ""One Belt One Road"", Hong Kong, as an important financial, commercial and maritime centre in the world, can provide Mainland enterprises that seek to ""go global"" with a wide range of professional services in the financial and legal arenas, including international investment, cross-border trade settlement, Renminbi (RMB) bond issuance and asset and risk management services.', '66.Last October, over 20 countries signed a memorandum of understanding in Beijing and formally announced a plan to establish the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). We shall endeavour to leverage our strength in financing and asset management to support its establishment and operation, and pursue actively the possibility of our joining AIIB.', '67.A two-pronged approach should be adopted to further develop our pillar industries. On the one hand, we shall capitalise on the new opportunities created by the ""One Belt One Road"" initiatives of our nation. On the other, we shall endeavour to speed up the pace of moving our industries up the value chain.']"
17,[Trading and Logistics Industry],"['68.Strategically located, and with an extensive trading network as well as a simple and open trading system, Hong Kong for years has been a regional trading and logistics hub underpinned by a well-established international transportation network.', ""69.We are among the world leaders in terms of both air and port cargo throughput. Last year, Hong Kong's visible trade, including re-exports, domestic exports and imports of goods, amounted to $8.4 trillion, approaching four times of GDP."", '70.To cater for the demand in modern supply chain management, the trading and logistics industry needs to develop towards the provision of high value-added services. In this respect, air cargo services are of growing importance. The cargo handled by the Hong Kong International Airport accounts for less than two per cent of our total freight volume by weight, but makes up nearly 40 per cent of our exports and imports by value.', '71.With rising passenger and cargo throughput at the Hong Kong International Airport, the existing two-runway system will reach its maximum capacity in a few years. It is imperative for us to take forward the development of a three-runway system (3RS) in order to meet our long-term air traffic demand, and to maintain our status as an international and regional aviation centre in the face of fierce competition from other airports in the region. Having gone through the environmental impact assessment process, the Airport Authority (AA) has submitted its recommendations on the planning of the 3RS to Government.', '72.I envisage that the construction works for the 3RS could commence in 2016 for commissioning in 2023. AA estimated that, with full operation of the system, the airport could handle 100 million passengers and 9 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2030.', '73.Aerospace financing is crucial to the development of high value-added aviation services. Asia sees the fastest growth in demand for aviation services, and an intense need for aerospace financing. We shall ride on the experience of other jurisdictions and explore possible measures that can promote aerospace financing business in Hong Kong.', '74.The lack of back-up land is a big problem confronting our logistics industry. The Transport and Housing Bureau has completed technical assessments for the ten hectares of logistics site reserved at Tuen Mun West. We shall consult the local community as early as possible and release the site for the use of the industry by phases.', '75.Apart from hardware, supporting software is also essential to strengthen our connection with overseas markets. We are examining how best to further streamline departments\' handling of import/export documents. The provision of one-stop customs clearance service through a ""Single Window"" will closely follow mainstream international development.', '76.The burgeoning of internet banking, electronic payment instruments and e-cheques in recent years has spurred the development of e-commerce. With regard to cross-border trade, Government will explore with the industries the feasibility of promoting the use of electronic letters of credit to reduce cost.', '77.While the strong growth of e-commerce generates business opportunities for the provision of logistics and delivery services, the prevalence of e-communication poses a challenge to traditional mail delivery business. We shall review the business operation of Hongkong Post with the objectives of enabling the department to further support the development of the logistics industry in Hong Kong and expand its service offerings in response to market needs.', '78.Hong Kong, the first among all members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), joined the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in late 2014. TFA will motivate WTO Members to improve and harmonise the import/export and customs procedures, thereby bringing down trading costs and speeding up goods movement.', ""79.The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is Hong Kong's fourth largest trading partner in terms of services and second largest in terms of goods. We started the free trade agreement negotiations with ASEAN in the middle of last year to secure favourable access of our goods, services and investment to this market of enormous potential."", '80.To enhance economic co-operation and integration between Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions, we are exploring a closer economic partnership arrangement with Macao. Such arrangement, coupled with those already signed respectively by Hong Kong and Macao with the Mainland, will constitute a new economic and trade co-operation platform for the region.']"
18,[Tourism],"['81.Tourism, making up five per cent of GDP and employing 270 000 people, has been driving the growth of many industries. In 2014, visitors to Hong Kong exceeded 60 million, an increase of 12 per cent over last year. Total spending went up by nine per cent to more than $350 billion.', '82.Our tourism industry would continue moving up the value chain to attract high-spending visitors. We shall explore the construction of a convention centre above the Exhibition Station of the Shatin to Central Link to draw in more international business visitors. We shall also work with the Guangdong and Macao authorities to promote multi-destination tourism for overseas visitors, and invite neighbouring ports to join the Asia Cruise Fund with a view to encouraging cruise companies to include Hong Kong in their itineraries.', '83.On tourist facilities, Government will discuss with the Walt Disney Company the Phase 2 development of the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. This phase will cover an estimated area of 60 hectares, similar to that of Phase 1, with attractions, hotel development and retail facilities.', '84.The construction of the ""Iron Man Experience"" in Hong Kong Disneyland and the waterpark at Tai Shue Wan in Ocean Park is expected to complete in 2016-17. The new Central harbourfront will add new elements to the renowned scenic views of Victoria Harbour. In addition to sightseeing facilities such as the Observation Wheel, a variety of carnivals, exhibitions and open-air concerts will take place from time to time. These new facilities at the harbourfront will provide novel experiences that will keep visitors and locals amused.', '85.The new hotel projects in Hong Kong Disneyland, Ocean Park and the airport\'s North Commercial District will come on stream, providing a total of over 2 200 rooms. Ocean Park has also invited expressions of interest for the development of the proposed Fisherman\'s Wharf Hotel. Furthermore, the sites facing Victoria Harbour within the ""hotel belt"" adjacent to the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal will be made available to the market starting from the end of this year.', ""86.Hong Kong has many locations suitable for alfresco dining where visitors can enjoy delicacies and Hong Kong's spectacular scenery at the same time. I have asked relevant departments to implement as early as possible the proposal to facilitate alfresco dining operation, and to consider introducing Food Trucks, which is popular abroad, to the mix of Hong Kong's existing food scene.""]"
19,[Business and Professional Services],"['87.Business and professional services generate many quality employment opportunities for Hong Kong. Our accounting, legal, architectural and engineering sectors are highly competitive. Their professional services are on a par with international standards and the systems adopted dovetail with those in the advanced regions. These sectors have earned the trust of Mainland and overseas enterprises.']"
20,[CEPA],"[""88.Since the introduction of the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) in 2003, ten Supplements to CEPA have been concluded between the Mainland and Hong Kong to expand market liberalisation and further facilitate trade and investment. CEPA has presented tremendous development opportunities to Hong Kong's service suppliers and professionals. Up till now we have issued 3 000 Certificates of Hong Kong Service Supplier and thousands of Hong Kong residents have set up individually-owned stores in the Mainland in accordance with the preferential treatment under CEPA."", ""89.At the end of last year, I signed a new agreement with the Ministry of Commerce to promote liberalisation of trade in services between Hong Kong and Guangdong. After the agreement comes into effect, Guangdong will open up 153 services trade sub-sectors to Hong Kong service suppliers, accounting for 95.6 per cent of all trade sub-sectors under the WTO's classification system. I hope the Mainland will further deepen the liberalisation measures on this basis and extend them nationwide, thereby achieving basic liberalisation of trade in services between the entire Mainland and Hong Kong by the end of this year.""]"
21,[Intellectual    Property Trading],"['90.As an international business centre, Hong Kong is well placed to become a premier IP trading hub providing high value-added IP services in the region. I shall earmark $23 million in the coming three years for offering IP consultation, manpower training and other services to SMEs.

For the capital markets of the two places to move towards full mutual access, we shall review the experience of the implementation of this project, and discuss with the relevant authorities of the Central Government the launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and enhancement of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect. We shall also work with the industry to stage roadshows in the Mainland to promote Hong Kong's securities market to Mainland investors."", ""94.While we strengthen our connection with the Mainland market, we are also expanding our RMB business links with the rest of the world. Hong Kong is the world's largest centre for offshore RMB banking, financing and asset management, providing services for RMB transactions around the world."", ""95.Last year, RMB trade settlement conducted through Hong Kong banks amounted to RMB 6.3 trillion, with a 60 per cent year-on-year increase, while RMB bond issuance amounted to RMB 200 billion, with a 70 per cent year-on-year increase. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the average daily turnover on Hong Kong's RMB Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system amounted to RMB 850 billion, representing an 80 per cent increase over the same period a year earlier."", ""96.We shall continue to actively develop Hong Kong's capacity to serve as a global hub for offshore RMB business, providing new opportunities for the financial sectors both in the Mainland and Hong Kong.

Furthermore, we are formulating legislative proposals to provide the legal framework for introducing an open-ended fund company structure."", '99.To attract multinational and Mainland enterprises to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong to perform treasury services for their group companies, we shall amend the Inland Revenue Ordinance to allow, under specified conditions, interest deductions under profits tax for corporate treasury centres and reducing profits tax for specified treasury activities by 50 per cent. The relevant bill will be introduced in the 2015-16 legislative session.']"

The US$1 billion issuance marked the world's first US dollar-denominated sukuk originated by a government with the highest credit rating, setting a significant pricing benchmark for the market. Drawing a strong demand from investors, the sukuk issuance won a number of awards. The successful offering highlighted that the relevant legal framework in Hong Kong has been widely accepted by international investors. Government will consider actively a further sukuk issuance when market conditions are favourable, in a bid to attract more issuers and investors into the local market."", '101.The inflation-linked retail bonds (iBond) introduced in 2011 have been well received by the public and helped promote the retail bond market. I shall launch an iBond issue of up to $10 billion with a maturity of three years. Following the existing practice, the issuance will target Hong Kong residents, and interest will be paid to bond holders every six months at a rate linked to the inflation rates of the last half-year period.

26,[Overcoming Limitations],"['102.While augmenting further the competitiveness of our pillar industries and fostering diversification of our industries, we must strive to overcome the limitations that hamper economic growth.']"
27,[Human Resources],"['103.People are the most important asset for Hong Kong. The future of our city hinges upon the quality of people. For generations, Hong Kong people have strived to raise themselves up the social ladder through hard work and self-improvement. Government has been devoting substantial resources to improving the quality of manpower to further diversify the economy and steer the development towards high value-added activities.', '104.With specialisation and division of labour in different sectors in modern society, there is growing demand for talent with specific expertise and skills. Young people are offered different options to pursue promising careers. Government has been working closely with different sectors to provide professional training for various trades and industries including construction, retail, clock and watch, printing, health care, and testing and certification. The active engagement of trades and industries, which effectively enhances their professional image and provides clear career pathways, is crucial in attracting new entrants.', '105.Skills mismatch in the labour market is becoming more evident in recent years. Chronic manpower shortage and recruitment difficulties in individual sectors will hamper the sustainable and diversified economic development. While according priority to locals in employment, we should seriously consider importing manpower in an appropriate, limited and targeted manner to inject new impetus into the labour market.']"
28,[Manpower Training],"[""106.In last year's Budget, I announced the allocation of $130 million to support the manpower development of the retail industry. The series of measures are being rolled out. The first programme for the Earn and Learn Pilot Scheme for the Retail Industry which is run by the Vocational Training Council in collaboration with the industry commenced last September, with the first cohort of student-trainees started coursework and on-the-job training in tandem. The Hong Kong Productivity Council has also launched the Retail Technology Adoption Assistance Scheme for Manpower Demand Management to assist the sector in enhancing productivity. Preparation for the retail industry promotion campaign is under way to enhance the image of the industry with a view to attracting new blood."", '107.With our strenuous efforts to promote the professional image and promising career prospects of the construction industry in recent years, more young people are willing to join the industry. Over the past five years, I have allocated a total of $320 million to the Construction Industry Council (CIC) to train local workers through the provision of training allowances and on-site experience. This year, I shall provide another $100 million for the CIC to train up more skilled workers to meet the acute manpower demand of the industry.', '108.The financial services industry has a keen demand for quality personnel. Last year, I requested the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) to consult the industry on manpower training needs. There was broad consensus that manpower shortage was particularly acute in the insurance and the asset and wealth management sectors. They also suggested that Government could help promote the industry, enhance the professional competence of practitioners and, in particular, train up more talent for middle and back offices.', '109.I shall allocate $100 million to launch a three-year pilot scheme for insurance and asset and wealth management services. Under the scheme, Government will collaborate with the industry to organise activities and provide internship opportunities to allow the community, in particular students, to have a better understanding of the nature and career prospects of different jobs in the two sectors. Government and industry will also enhance the contents of continuing professional development programmes, and provide financial support to encourage practitioners to enrol in these programmes. FSTB is drawing up details of the pilot scheme.', '110.From the 2015/16 academic year onwards, Government will subsidise on a pilot basis 1 000 students per cohort to pursue designated self-financing undergraduate programmes for meeting the manpower needs of Hong Kong. For the first cohort, there will be 13 programmes, covering health care, architecture and engineering, testing and certification, creative industry, logistics, as well as tourism and hospitality. This scheme will cost $960 million.', '111.We shall open up more internship and exchange opportunities for young people to experience the taste of work, broaden their exposure, and be prepared for entering the job market.', '112.We plan to increase the short-term internship places provided by government departments for 2015-16 to 3 000, an increase of 30 per cent over the last financial year, so that more young people will have a deeper understanding of different areas of work in Government. This measure will cost $21 million.', '113.Last year, the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Singapore started to arrange internships in ASEAN countries to broaden the international horizons of university students of Hong Kong and enhance their understanding of ASEAN countries. The inaugural round of the scheme saw 90 students taking up internships. A total of 250 internship places will be available in 2015-16.', '114.I shall also allocate an additional $205 million in the next three years to support more young people to participate in Mainland exchange and internship programmes.']"

Improving the environment is high on our agenda."", '116.Government will phase out 82 000 Euro III or earlier diesel commercial vehicles by the end of 2019, involving an ex-gratia payment of $11.4 billion. So far, 22 000 of these vehicles have been phased out, and we shall continue to assist the transport industry in resolving relevant issues. The $80 million programme to support replacement of catalytic converters and oxygen sensors of liquefied petroleum gas taxis and light buses was also completed last year. A total of 18 000 taxis and light buses took part in the programme, accounting for 80 per cent of the eligible vehicles.', '117.The port facilities and light dues charged on ocean-going vessels (OGVs) are now reduced by half if these vessels use low sulphur fuel while at berth in Hong Kong. I propose extending this incentive scheme until the end of March 2018, which will involve revenue foregone of $240 million. We shall introduce legislation this year to require all OGVs at berth in Hong Kong to use low sulphur diesel.', '118.Since its launch in 2008, the Cleaner Production Partnership Programme has funded a total of 2 400 cleaner production projects and promotion activities, helping Hong Kong-owned factories in both Hong Kong and Guangdong reduce emissions, conserve energy, etc. We shall allocate an additional $150 million to extend the programme for five years.', '119.To promote the use of electric vehicles, I announced last year that the First Registration Tax exemption for electric vehicles would be extended up to the end of March 2017. We installed 100 faster chargers for electric vehicles at 16 government car parks last year, which can shorten the charging time. The total number of chargers in the territory has increased to 1 100.', '120.The Harbour Area Treatment Scheme collects sewage from both sides of Victoria Harbour for treatment at Stonecutters Island to improve the water quality of Victoria Harbour proper. Stage 2A of the scheme will come into operation this year. Stage 1 and Stage 2A of the scheme together cost $25.8 billion. We plan to commission a new consultancy study on enhancing the leisure and recreational value of the coastal areas of Victoria Harbour in the long run.', ""121.We shall start working on the design of a desalination plant at Tseung Kwan O and the associated infrastructure in phases this year. It is expected that the desalination plant will commence operation in 2020 and the annual output will account for five to ten per cent of Hong Kong's fresh water consumption. We shall apply the relevant state-of-the-art technology, including efficient energy recovery system, for greater energy efficiency, increased output and lower cost."", '122.To minimise water loss, we shall progressively establish Water Intelligent Network by installing sensors in the water supply networks to monitor their conditions. We shall also examine other techniques, such as data mining, to predict water main bursts for early identification and handling of defective water mains.']"
30,[Land Resources],"['123.Land, apart from manpower, is the other major constraint to the economic and social development in Hong Kong. To make room for economic, social and personal development, we shall optimise land utilisation and increase land supply through a combination of measures.']"
31,[Residential Land],"['124.Government promulgated the new Long Term Housing Strategy at the end of last year, setting the target for public housing supply at 290 000 units for the coming decade. As the major provider of public housing in Hong Kong, HKHA cannot afford the expenditure to be incurred in the long run.', '125.The Housing Reserve I set up last December is to provide financial resources to meet the ten-year public housing supply target. The initial injection is the investment returns generated in 2014, which amounted to $27.5 billion. Further injections will be considered at an appropriate juncture.', ""126.A total of 20 residential sites were put up for sale by Government in 2014-15, capable of providing 6 300 private residential units. Taking into account the railway property development projects, the Urban Renewal Authority's projects and private redevelopment or development projects, the land supply has a capacity of producing 20 000 units."", '127.The 2015-16 Land Sale Programme will include 29 residential sites capable of providing 16 000 units in total. Out of these sites, 16 are new ones. Taking into account the housing land supply from different sources, I expect that a total of 19 000 units can be provided. The Secretary for Development will announce tomorrow the Land Sale Programme for the coming financial year.', '128.To promote market circulation of subsidised housing, HKMC will consider launching a new Premium Loan Guarantee Scheme to help owners of subsidised sale flats pay the premium to HKHA or HKHS. After settling the premium payment, owners will have greater flexibility in disposing of their flats, such as letting out or selling the flats in the open market.', '129.The property market has revived since April last year, with both flat prices and transactions showing renewed pick-up. There has been a double-digit increase in the prices of small and medium-sized flats. Meanwhile, the external environment is volatile. The timing and pace of the US interest rate hike as well as the further monetary easing measures of the central banks of Eurozone and Japan could have significant impact on the local property market. The public should be extra cautious when making decision on purchasing property, and carefully assess the potential risk they need to bear in case of a market downturn. Government will continue to monitor the market conditions closely, and I will not hesitate to introduce measures when necessary, in order to maintain the healthy and stable development of the property market and safeguard the stability of our macroeconomic and financial systems.']"
32,[Commercial Land],"['130.In 2014-15, Government put up for sale a total of five sites for commercial/industrial use and one for hotel development, providing 180 000 square metres of floor area and 1 100 rooms respectively. The Land Sale Programme for the coming financial year will include four sites for commercial/business use and one for hotel development, providing 180 000 square metres of floor area and 500 rooms respectively.', '131.We shall increase the supply of commercial floor area through other channels, including relocating government offices away from core business districts. The plan will not only release valuable sites for commercial use, but also generate more economic activities and employment opportunities in various districts.', '132.The government offices in the Trade and Industry Department Tower in Mong Kok will be relocated to the Kai Tak Development Area starting in the middle of this year, releasing 18 000 square metres of commercial floor area.', '133.We are actively taking forward our plan to relocate the three government office buildings in Wan Chai. The 29 departments accommodated there will be relocated in phases to buildings under planning in various districts, including West Kowloon, Cheung Sha Wan, Kai Tak, Chai Wan and Tseung Kwan O. This will progressively release 175 000 square metres of commercial floor area and increase the supply of Grade A office space in Wan Chai.']"
33,[Ageing Population],"['134.The ageing population is a formidable challenge to us. Our labour force will decline as from 2018 and our economic vibrancy will be dampened. The growth of the elderly population will push up demands for healthcare and elderly services, thus increasing public expenditure. We shall encourage the potential workforce to enter or re-enter the labour market. We shall continue to allocate resources to improve healthcare and elderly services.']"
34,[Encouraging Employment],"['135.Economic growth is mainly contingent on the working population and its productivity. Encouraging more women and older persons to join the workforce will help boost our economic growth.', '136.I shall allocate $130 million to strengthen child care services, thus providing support for women to achieve a work-family balance. This year, we shall extend the coverage of on-the-job training allowance under the Employment Programme for the Middle-aged to encourage the employment of older persons to take up part-time jobs. The Employees Retraining Board will also focus on providing training for older persons, among other target groups, and help them re-join the job market.', '137.I shall earmark $220 million to extend for two years the Integrated Employment Assistance Programme for Self-reliance, which encourages employable able-bodied CSSA recipients to secure employment and achieve self-reliance.', '138.The Labour Department will also continue to employ, on a trial basis, ethnic minority trainees under the Youth Employment and Training Programme as employment services ambassadors to provide employment services to other ethnic minority job seekers.', '139.I encourage employers to introduce more flexible working arrangements. I hope they would allow employees to work from home, or offer part-time and job sharing alternatives, to enable more people with family commitments to join the workforce.']"
35,[Healthcare],"[""140.With ageing population, Government will continue to increase resources on healthcare. In 2015-16, Government's recurrent allocation to the Hospital Authority (HA) will be $49 billion, up by nearly 50 per cent over five years ago."", ""141.To cater for the long-term demand for healthcare services, we shall carry out a number of hospital projects. Projects already under construction or planning include the development of an acute general hospital in the Kai Tak Development Area (Phase 1), Tin Shui Wai Hospital and Hong Kong Children's Hospital; the redevelopment of Kwong Wah Hospital and Queen Mary Hospital; and the expansion of United Christian Hospital. A total of 2 800 additional beds will be provided. The works expenditure is estimated at $81 billion."", '142.In the 2008-09 Budget, I earmarked $50 billion to support healthcare reform. I shall, in light of public views, inject funds into the high risk pool under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, and provide tax concession for subscribers to regulated insurance products. To alleviate pressure on the public healthcare system due to manpower shortages and surge in demand, I shall set up a fund for HA to make use of investment returns for public-private partnership initiatives. One of these is to extend in phases the General Out-patient Clinic Public-Private Partnership Programme to all 18 districts. I shall also offer loans to non-profit-making organisations for private hospital development to address the acute shortage of private hospital beds. The remaining sum will be reserved for general use, including provision of support for public hospital projects.']"
36,[Retirement Protection],"['143.Government has, since the 1960s, been studying different forms of retirement protection, on which there have been wide discussions and diverse views in the community. The Commission on Poverty will consult the public again on retirement protection in the latter half of this year.', '144.The sustainability of retirement protection must be a prime concern. ""Pay-as-you-go"" retirement protection means that the contributions from today\'s employees and employers are used to pay the pensions of retirees of the previous generation. In other words, funding for retirement protection for people in this generation is to be borne by the next generation.', '145.Overseas experiences suggest that, as population ages, the proportion of dependants to the working population increases, retirement protection on a ""pay-as-you-go"" basis eventually becomes unsustainable. There would either be less protection for the dependent population or heavier burden on the working population. We should consider carefully the consequences of this scenario when we discuss retirement protection.', ""146.Irrespective of the community's choice for the way forward on this issue, the community's consensus is to provide better retirement protection for the elderly in need. I shall set aside $50 billion for this purpose.""]"
37,[Public Finances],"['147.In its report released last year, the Working Group on Long-Term Fiscal Planning pointed out that with an ageing population and slowing economic growth, government expenditure would keep growing at a faster pace than that of revenue and the economy. If this trend persists, structural deficits will surface within ten years. While Hong Kong would still experience budget surpluses in the coming few years, we need to take early and positive actions to contain expenditure, preserve the revenue base and save up in a timely manner to avoid the appearance of structural deficits.']"
38,[Containing Expenditure],"['148.In light of the Working Group\'s recommendations, I asked all policy bureaux in the middle of last year to achieve more efficient use of resources through re-engineering and re-prioritising. I have also launched the ""0‑1‑1"" envelope savings programme to reduce operating expenditure by a total of two per cent over the next three financial years. Resources saved will be re-allocated for new services.']"
39,[Preserving Revenue Base],"['149.Hong Kong maintains a simple and low tax regime with a narrow tax base. Among the working population, only 40 per cent pays salaries tax, and 60 per cent of the revenue comes from the top five per cent of the payers of salaries tax. As for profits tax, only ten per cent of the registered corporations pay the tax, and over 80 per cent of the revenue comes from the top five per cent of payers of profits tax. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for Government to stabilise and broaden the revenue base.', '150.Two years ago, I asked government departments to comprehensively review over a thousand fees and charges in accordance with the ""cost-recovery"" and ""user pays"" principles. The review is supported by LegCo and our efforts have begun to bear fruits. We shall next review livelihood-related fees and charges.', '151.Government launched an extensive consultation on the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax in 2006. The community then did not support the new tax. We may explore again the feasibility of broadening the tax base in due course with the aim of stabilising government revenue and creating room for direct tax concessions.']"
40,[Saving up in a Timely Manner],"['152.In late 2014, the Working Group suggested establishing a Future Fund, comprising an endowment of $220 billion from the Land Fund, which is part of the fiscal reserves, and a proportion of future budget surpluses. The Future Fund will serve as long-term savings and be placed in long-term investments for higher returns.', '153.I agree to establish a Future Fund. I have requested the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury to work with the Chief Executive of HKMA to hammer out specific management and investment mechanisms. The savings scheme is expected to be in place within this year.', ""154.The Working Group also offered recommendations on how Government's assets could be better managed. We shall follow up on their recommendations. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the experts and academics on the Working Group for their contributions over the past two years.""]"
41,[Revised Estimates for 2014-15],"['155.I forecast that the revised estimate for government revenue for 2014-15 will be $470.7 billion, 9.4 per cent or $40.6 billion higher than the original estimate. It reflects mainly the changes in the following revenue items and the arrangement for the Housing Reserve –', '156.As for government expenditure, I forecast a revised estimate of $397.2 billion, 3.4 per cent or $14 billion lower than the original estimate.', '157.For 2014-15, I forecast a surplus of $63.8 billion, and by 31 March 2015, fiscal reserves are expected to reach $819.5 billion.', '(a)stamp duty revenue is $29.7billion higher than the original estimate, representing an increase of over 60percent. Of this revenue, over 75percent comes from ""double stamp duty"" which was not budgeted;', '(b)revenue from profits tax is $18.5billion or 15.8percent higher than originally estimated. It is affected mainly by corporate earnings which are far more volatile than macroeconomic growth, rendering it difficult for us to make an accurate estimate; and', '(c)revenues from salaries tax and land premium are $5.1billion and $3.2billion higher than their respective original estimates.']"
42,[Estimates for 2015-16],"[""158.Operating expenditure for 2015-16 is estimated to be $354.3 billion, representing an increase of 11.5 per cent or $36.6 billion over the revised estimate for 2014-15. Recurrent expenditure accounts for $324.6 billion, or over 90 per cent of the 2015-16 operating expenditure, which is an increase of $18.3 billion or six per cent over the revised estimate for 2014-15. In the past ten years, recurrent expenditure has been increasing with a cumulative growth of 73.4 per cent over 2005-06. This demonstrates Government's continued commitment towards improving people's livelihood."", '159.Of the recurrent expenditure for the next financial year, almost 60 per cent will be deployed for education, health and social welfare, the three major livelihood-related policy areas. Recurrent expenditure on education, the largest spending area of Government, will be $71.4 billion, or 22 per cent of recurrent expenditure. New initiatives to be introduced from the 2015/16 academic year include progressively increasing the intake of senior-year undergraduate places in University Grants Committee-funded institutions from 4 000 to 5 000 per annum in the 2018/19 academic year, costing $475 million a year; and increasing the ratio of graduate teacher posts in public sector primary schools in phases, costing $328 million a year. Further to the increase in voucher value of the Pre-primary Education Voucher Scheme by $2,500 in the 2014/15 school year, the voucher value will again be adjusted upward by $2,500 in the 2015/16 school year; and the fee remission ceiling of the Kindergarten and Child Care Centre Fee Remission Scheme will also be raised in these two school years. These will involve additional expenditure of $840 million in the two school years.', ""160.Recurrent expenditure on medical and health services will be $54.5 billion, accounting for 16.8 per cent of recurrent expenditure. We shall continue to enhance our public healthcare services. Measures include providing 250 additional hospital beds, expanding the capacity of specialist out-patient clinics and general out-patient clinics, strengthening geriatric rehabilitation and outreach services, and increasing operating theatre sessions. More drugs with proven efficacy will be incorporated into the Hospital Authority Drug Formulary. These include the expansion of clinical application of special drug for treating multiple sclerosis, as well as new drugs for treating cancer, chronic hepatitis C and Crohn's disease. A total of 4 000 patients will benefit each year."", ""161.Recurrent expenditure on welfare will reach $59.7 billion, accounting for 18.4 per cent of recurrent expenditure. Ever since it was launched three years ago, the Public Transport Fare Concession Scheme for the Elderly and Eligible Persons with Disabilities has gradually been extended to cover MTR, franchised buses and ferries to benefit more people. From late March 2015, the scheme will be extended to cover green minibuses by phases. The recurrent expenditure of the scheme has increased by threefold to $900 million in three years' time. In addition, I shall increase the annual recurrent expenditure by $71 million to provide additional places for day care and residential care for the elderly, and improve relevant services. Government will also strengthen various support services for persons with disabilities and ex-mentally ill persons, including residential care services and community support services, which will involve an additional annual expenditure of $160 million."", '162.I forecast that capital expenditure for 2015-16 will be $86.5 billion, including $70 billion on capital works. We have launched various capital works in recent years for developing transport infrastructure, increasing land supply, as well as medical, educational and leisure facilities, etc. They are of paramount importance in furthering socio-economic development and enhancing quality of life.', '163.With a number of projects entering their construction peaks, capital works expenditure is expected to maintain at relatively high levels in the next few years. We are, however, concerned about the sluggish progress of deliberation in LegCo since the last session. This has resulted in the mounting of backlog of funding proposals.', '164.Total government expenditure is estimated to reach $440.8 billion in the next financial year, 11 per cent more than that of last year. Public expenditure will be equivalent to 20.4 per cent of GDP.', '165.The civil service establishment is expected to expand by 2 540 posts to 176 448 in 2015-16, representing a year-on-year increase of 1.5 per cent, similar to that of 2014-15. This has to do with manpower increase in government departments for implementing new policies and improving existing services.', '166.Total government revenue for 2015-16 is estimated to be $477.6 billion, of which earnings and profits tax is estimated at $194.6 billion. Land revenue is estimated to be $70 billion.', '167.Taking all these into account, I forecast a surplus of $36.8 billion in the Consolidated Account in the coming year. Fiscal reserves are estimated to be $856.3 billion by the end of March 2016, representing 36.8 per cent of GDP and equivalent to 23 months of government expenditure.']"
43,[Medium Range Forecast],"[""168.Since the global financial crisis in 2008, the annual growth rate of Hong Kong's economy averaged 2.6 per cent in real terms, lower than our average trend growth rate of 3.8 per cent in the decade before the crisis."", '169.For the medium term, the average annual growth rate is forecast to be 3.5 per cent in real terms from 2016 to 2019, and the underlying inflation rate will average three per cent.', '170.I forecast an annual surplus in the Operating Account and an annual deficit in the Capital Account in the four years from 2016‑17. But a surplus is expected in the Consolidated Account in all years.', '171.Fiscal reserves are estimated at $948.8 billion by end-March 2020, representing 33.6 per cent of GDP and equivalent to 22 months of government expenditure.', '172.The medium range forecast is broadly in line with the trend projections of the Working Group. The ageing population will inevitably put mounting pressure on government expenditure and a shrinking workforce will slow down economic growth. We must remain vigilant, and take timely and resolute multi-pronged measures to avert the structural deficit problem.']"
44,[Concluding Remarks],"['173.Mr President, on 26 February 2014, less than an hour before the delivery of my last Budget Speech, an old friend of mine was assaulted on his way to work, suffering six chop wounds. This unthinkable violence is my abiding memory of the last Budget. I am glad to see him returning to work and a normal life after a year of treatment and rehabilitation.', '174.This is my eighth Budget since I became Financial Secretary in 2007. Throughout these eight years, Hong Kong has remained economically stable and financially healthy despite global economic turbulence and financial market volatility.', ""175.Hong Kong's success has been built on our sound social system and shared values over the decades. People here have different opinions, different likes and dislikes, and different faiths. But, we can still live together harmoniously and our society can still operate effectively. However, events in recent years seem to have impacted on the system and common values. This is huge concern to me."", '176.It is perfectly normal to have dissenting voices and controversies in a diversified and pluralistic society such as Hong Kong. What really matters is to remain objective, rational and pragmatic in handling disagreements. Regrettably, the extremes of stance means that the social bickering of recent years has not led to any solutions to our problems. I am never afraid of an argument or debate as long as they are constructive. If not, then we are just wasting our time without doing any good for Hong Kong.', '177.A psychologist once said, ""For our chronically and extremely hungry man, Utopia can be defined very simply as a place where there is plenty of food. ...
