0,Introduction,"['Mr President, Honourable Members and fellowcitizens,', 'I move that the Appropriation Bill 2021 be read a second time.', 'Introduction', '2.Over the past year, we all have experienced a very different life. The epidemic has aggravated the economic recession. Face masks have become a daily necessity. We might have spent more time at home, but we have fewer opportunities to gather with our relatives and friends. The year 2020 has become our common memory.', '3.The epidemic has made us realise that globalisation is not only a driving force for economic development, but also the key to victory in the fight against viruses and epidemics. No place on earth can stay aloof and remain unaffected. Only with concerted efforts can we successfully beat this pandemic of the century that has plagued the entire world.', ""4.Hong Kong went through tribulations in the past two years. International political tensions have dampened local exports and market sentiments; violent clashes have endangered the stability and safety of our society; and the epidemic has exerted additional pressure on the whole community and economy. In the past year, Hong Kong's economy recorded a negative growth of 6.1 per cent with the latest unemployment rate rising to seven per cent. The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has committed a total of nearly $300 billion for supporting measures, with a view to stabilising the economy and relieving people's burden. However, this has also brought the fiscal deficit to a record high."", '5.With the epidemic still lingering, our economy is yet to come out of recession. Our most urgent task is to contain the epidemic and press ahead with the vaccination programme, so that people and businesses can be back on track, and safe travelling between Hong Kong and the Mainland as well as the rest of the world can be resumed as soon as possible. I will, as always, provide the resources required to fully support the anti-epidemic work.', ""6.This year's Budget focuses on stabilising the economy and relieving people's burden. It aims to alleviate the hardship and pressure caused by the economic downturn and the epidemic through the introduction of counter-cyclical measures costing over $120 billion; and seeks to create a leverage effect to benefit our people, workers as well as enterprises. It is equally important that we should grasp the major directions and new trends of future development to strategically enhance our policy steering, support measures and resources allocation in key areas. This will not only bring new impetus to our industries, but also enable them to have a more dynamic, diverse and interactive development. I will go into more details in the ensuing paragraphs.""]"
1,Economic Situation in 2020,"['EconomicSituation in 2020', ""7.Last year, the COVIDâ€‘19 pandemic ravaged the world, causing unprecedented repercussions on the global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that the global economy contracted significantly by 3.5 per cent for the year as a whole. At the onset of the outbreak, governments around the world implemented stringent social distancing requirements and widespread lockdowns, plunging many major economies into a deep recession in the first half of last year. Amid a sharp fall in external demand caused by the epidemic, Hong Kong's total exports of goods tumbled by 9.7 per cent year-on-year in real terms in the first quarter of last year. Later, with a strong rebound in the Mainland economy after its epidemic situation was kept under control and the gradual recovery of other major economies in the second half of the year, Hong Kong's total exports of goods resumed growth in the second half of the year. Yet, there was still a mild decrease of 0.3 per cent for the year as a whole."", '8.Under the threat of the epidemic, inbound tourism was brought to a frozen state for most of the time last year amid extensive travel restrictions worldwide. Exports of travel services fell drastically by 90.5 per cent for the year as a whole. Exports of financial services saw a moderate growth in the period, but total exports of services still registered a record decline of 36.8 per cent for the year as a whole. ', '9.Given the volatile local epidemic situation, social distancing measures were tightened from time to time. This, coupled with the weak job and income conditions, has dampened local consumer sentiments. Private consumption expenditure dropped significantly by 10.1 per cent for the year as a whole despite some narrowing of the decline in the second half of the year. Amid the highly uncertain business outlook, investment expenditure fell by 11.5 per cent.', ""10.Hong Kong's overall economy contracted substantially by nine per cent in the first half of last year. While a slight improvement was seen in the third quarter, it has been hit again by the epidemic since the latter part of the fourth quarter. For 2020 as a whole, the economy contracted by 6.1 per cent, the largest annual decline on record. It is also the first time for Hong Kong to register two consecutive years of negative growth."", '11.The labour market deteriorated sharply. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate went up from 3.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019 to seven per cent in the latest period, the highest in close to 17 years. Amid the epidemic, the consumption- and tourism-related sectors were hit hard. The unemployment rate of the retail, accommodation and food services sectors combined rose to 11.3 per cent. In particular, the unemployment rate of the food and beverage services sector reached a high level of 14.7 per cent. The unemployment rate of the construction sector also reached a double- digit level. Household incomes fell markedly in the year.', ""12.Amid a lacklustre economy, pressures on consumer price inflation were modest. Netting out the effects of the Government's one-off measures, the underlying inflation rate was 1.3 per cent for last year as a whole, down 1.7 percentage point from the year before."", '13.As for the property market, the residential property market was generally stable last year. Prices of commercial and industrial properties fell visibly from their peak in 2019, and transaction volume dropped to a record low. Following the relaxation of macro- prudential measures for mortgage loans on non-residential properties by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), as well as the abolition of the Doubled Ad Valorem Stamp Duty on non- residential property transactions by the Government, there was a slight rebound in transactions in the latter part of last year. ']"
2,Economic Outlook for 2021 and Medium-term Outlook,"['EconomicOutlook for 2021 and Medium-term Outlook', '14.With the launch of vaccination schemes in various places around the world, the global economy may see relatively significant improvements starting from the latter half of 2021. Last month, the IMF forecast that the global economy will rebound by 5.5 per cent this year.', '15.The Mainland economy was hard hit by the epidemic in early 2020. Nevertheless, with the epidemic swiftly put under control and vigorous macro policies implemented in a timely manner, the Mainland economy experienced a strong rebound since the second quarter with an annual growth of 2.3 per cent, making our country the only major economy in the world that achieved a positive growth. Looking ahead, though there are still uncertainties arising from the global epidemic situation and the China-US relations, the Mainland economy is fundamentally sound. The Central Economic Work Conference held at the end of last year emphasised that the continuity, stability and sustainability of the macro policies would be maintained to provide the necessary support for economic recovery on an ongoing basis. All these would be conducive to robust economic growth in the Mainland.', '16.The US economy has begun to pick up since the third quarter of last year. With the rollout of a vaccination programme and the support of fiscal stimulus measures, as well as the easy monetary environment, market forecasts generally point to faster economic growth in the US this year. The economy in Europe has slowed down again recently due to the resurgence of the pandemic. Nevertheless, with stronger policy support provided by the European Central Bank since late last year, the eurozone economy is expected to rebound later this year, provided that vaccines are widely applied. Once the epidemic is contained, Japan and other economies in Asia will also see a visible recovery this year.', '17.The foreign and economic policy directions of the US administration is the attention of the whole world. Their implications on the China-US relations and their economies are of particular significance. The global community hopes that China-US economic and trade relations can gradually be back to normal, thereby supporting further revival of global trade and business activities. However, as seen from the developments in the past few years, there remain many deep-seated conflicts between the two nations. Looking ahead, relations between the two nations will remain in a state of continued tensions, and on-going competition but without a total break-down. Changes in China-US relations will affect the global trade, finance and political landscape. External factors such as geopolitical situations and possible financial risks associated with the surging global public debt also warrant attention.', ""18.Hong Kong's economy is expected to resume positive growth this year, but the progress of economic recovery will hinge on the development of the epidemic. As cross-boundary movement of people and tourism activities take time to resume normal, the economy will still face significant challenges in the first half of the year. Nevertheless, as long as the community gather together to control the epidemic and social stability is maintained, economic recovery will likely gain a stronger momentum in the second half of the year in tandem with an expected rebound in the global economy. Having regard to the latest internal and external situations as well as the stimulus effect of the fiscal measures, I forecast that our economy will grow by 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent in real terms this year."", '19.On inflation, external price pressures are expected to remain modest. After two consecutive years of contraction, overall economic activities will remain below the pre-recession level this year and should not pose notable pressure on local costs. I forecast that the headline inflation rate and the underlying inflation rate will be 1.6 per cent and one per cent respectively this year.', '20.In the medium term, Hong Kong will continue to benefit from the ongoing development of the Mainland and the shift in global economic gravity from West to East. The economic outlook is positive. Our country\'s economy will continue to advance during the 14th Fiveâ€‘Year Plan period. The signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement will further promote economic integration in the region. Hong Kong can open up greater room for development by leveraging the advantages under ""One Country, Two Systems"", playing its unique role as a gateway and an intermediary, integrating into the new overall development of our country, actively participating in the national dual circulation development strategy and seizing the opportunities brought by the development of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and the Belt and Road (B&R) Initiative. On the other hand, the Government will strive to overcome land and talent constraints, promote innovation and technology (I&T) development, invest in education and nurture talent, and strengthen connection with the world. Considering the above factors and taking into account the catch up growth that would follow the initial economic recovery this year, I forecast that Hong Kong\'s economy will grow by an average of 3.3 per cent per annum in real terms from 2022 to 2025, while the underlying inflation rate will average two per cent.']"
3,"Riding out the Storm, Fighting the Virus Together","['Riding out theStorm', 'Fighting the VirusTogether', ""21.It is the Government's top priority to contain the epidemic so that businesses and the public can be back to their daily routines. A high-level Steering Committee cum Command Centre led by the Chief Executive was set up in January 2020 to formulate strategies and measures swiftly in response to the development of the epidemic with a view to achieving the target of zero infection. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to those joining the fight against the epidemic, including healthcare staff as well as businesses and individuals who have been supporting the Government's antiâ€‘epidemic measures. I will continue to provide adequate resources to fully support the anti- epidemic work. "", '22.The Government strives to step up surveillance and testing efforts. In order to identify cases in the community as early as possible to help cut the transmission chains, various means are provided to collect specimens up to about 100 000 for testing each day. At present, the actual testing capacity of public and private laboratories in Hong Kong has reached the level of over 100 000 tests per day.', '23.The Government has allocated $4.7 billion from the Antiâ€‘epidemic Fund (AEF) to support the antiâ€‘epidemic work of the Hospital Authority (HA), ensuring sufficient support and protection for frontline healthcare staff. The Government also provides an additional allocation of $3,044 million mainly for the HA to establish and operate the Community Treatment Facility at the AsiaWorld-Expo and the Hong Kong Infection Control Centre at the North Lantau Hospital. The former has commenced services in phases since last August, and the latter from the end of this month.', '24.The Government has earmarked over $8.4 billion for the procurement and administration of COVIDâ€‘19 vaccines. Our target is to have the majority of the population vaccinated for free within 2021. The COVID-19 Vaccination Programme which started yesterday will provide vaccination for five priority groups of citizens. The Government will seek funding support from the Finance Committee (FC) of the Legislative Council (LegCo) in the end of this month to establish a vaccination indemnity fund with $1 billion.']"
4,Overcoming the Epidemic,"['Overcoming theEpidemic', ""25.The AEF is set up to enhance Hong Kong's capability in combating the epidemic and provide relief for industries and members of the public hit hard by the epidemic. The measures launched under the AEF and the relief measures that I put forward in my last Budget involve a total of over $300 billion, providing an expected support effect of more than five per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). "", ""26.Having regard to the financial affordability of the Government, I will implement the following measures to continue to support enterprises, safeguard jobs and relieve people's burden.""]"
5,Support Enterprises,"['SupportEnterprises', '27.To support enterprises, I will implement the following measures involving a total of about $9.5 billion:', '28.The Government has introduced a number of enhancements to the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme, including the rollout of the 90% Guarantee Product and the oneâ€‘year Special 100% Guarantee Product to provide enterprises with lowâ€‘interest loans or interest subsidies, as well as principal moratorium during which only interest payments have to be made, thus giving them some breathing space for recovery. As at the end of January, a total of $42.7 billion in loans was approved under the 100% Guarantee Product, benefiting over 20 000 enterprises, involving 260 000 employees. As the epidemic has been lingering on for over one year, in order to continue to relieve the cash flow pressure of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), I will extend the application period of the Special 100% Guarantee Product to the end of this year; further increase the maximum loan amount per enterprise from the total amount of employee wages and rents for 12 months to that for 18 months and raise the loan ceiling from $5 million to $6 million; extend the maximum repayment period from five years to eight years; and extend the maximum duration of principal moratorium from 12 months to 18 months. The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Insurance Limited (HKMCIL) will announce the details later.', '29.Further to the launching of the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme together with the banking sector in response to the epidemic in May last year, the HKMA announced in November that the scheme would be extended for six months to April 2021 having regard to the ongoing impact of the epidemic on economic activities. Some 120 000 eligible corporate customers are covered by the scheme. Under this scheme and other relief initiatives offered by banks, about 59 000 cases have been approved by banks to support enterprises as at end-January 2021, involving an amount of about $750 billion.', '(a)reducing profits tax for the year of assessment 2020/21 by 100 per cent, subject to a ceiling of $10,000. The reduction will be reflected in the final tax payable for the year of assessment 2020/21. This will benefit 128 000 businesses and reduce government revenue by $1,050 million;(b)providing rates concession for nonâ€‘domestic properties for four quarters of 2021â€‘22, subject to a ceiling of $5,000 per quarter in the first two quarters and a ceiling of $2,000 per quarter in the remaining two quarters for each rateable property. This proposal is estimated to involve 420 000 nonâ€‘domestic properties and reduce government revenue by $3.4 billion;', '(c)waiving the business registration fees for 2021â€‘22. This will benefit 1.5 million business operators and reduce government revenue by $3 billion;(d)continuing to waive 75 per cent of water and sewage charges payable by nonâ€‘domestic households for eight months starting from April 2021, subject to a monthly ceiling of $20,000 and $12,500 respectively per household. This will benefit 250 000 nonâ€‘domestic households and reduce government revenue by $680 million; and(e)continuing to grant the 75 per cent rental or fee concession currently applicable to eligible tenants of government properties and eligible short-term tenancies and waivers under the Lands Department for six months starting from April 2021. During the period, tenants who have to close their properties at the request of the Government will continue to receive full rental waiver for the duration of the closure. This will reduce government revenue by $1.4 billion.']"
6,Support Employment,"['SupportEmployment', ""30.Following the allocation of funding to enhance the Love Upgrading Special Scheme run by the Employees Retraining Board (ERB) in last year's Budget, the ERB launched the third tranche of the scheme in January this year to provide training and allowance for 20 000 trainees affected by the economic situation. The Government will ask the ERB to launch the fourth tranche of the scheme in July, which will last for six months until the end of this year, benefiting 20 000 trainees. The ERB will continue to provide more training options under the scheme and more online courses for trainees to engage in distance learning during the epidemic."", '31.Having regard to the advancement in technology and changes in learning mode, the Government plans to expand the scope of the Continuing Education Fund to include online courses to provide learners with more diversified ways of continuing learning. At the same time, we will ensure effective supervision over the quality of courses and teaching. The Government will consult the sector with a view to implementing the measure upon commencement of the new school term in September.', '32.In 2020â€‘21, the Government created about 31 000 time- limited jobs in the public and private sectors through the AEF. As at end-January, some 16 000 appointments were made. I propose to further allocate $6.6 billion to create around 30 000 time-limited jobs for a period up to 12 months.']"
7,Relieve People's Hardship,"[""Relieve People'sHardship"", '33.I will also introduce the following one-off measures to alleviate the impact of the economic downturn on the public:', '34.This prolonged economic downturn has plunged some people into financial difficulties. In view of this, many people have demanded temporary unemployment assistance. The Government has reiterated the policy considerations it has taken into account for not accepting the proposal, and instead provided a timeâ€‘limited special scheme under the CSSA Scheme to help the unemployed.', '35.Considering that many grassroots have been suffering from underemployment amid the epidemic, the Government proposes to relax the working hour requirements under the Working Family Allowance Scheme. Among them, the current basic working hour requirement of not fewer than 144 hours per month for non-single parent households will be substantially lowered by half for one year. The measure will be implemented in June at the earliest subject to FC approval.', '36.In order to provide an extra financing option for the unemployed, I suggest setting up a Special 100% Loan Guarantee for Individuals Scheme as a supplementary measure. The Government will offer a guarantee for loans provided under the scheme. The maximum loan amount per applicant is set at six times of his/her average monthly income during employment, subject to a ceiling of $80,000. There will be a principal moratorium for the first 12 months. Afterwards, the principal and interest can be repaid over a period of up to five years with an interest rate fixed at one per cent per annum. Applicants who have repaid loans in full as scheduled will be offered full reimbursement for the interest paid. Freelancers who provide proof of loss of income may also apply for the loan. The Government will provide a total guarantee commitment of $15 billion. The application period will last for six months. The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) will, in collaboration with the HKMCIL, announce the details in due course.', '37.Amid the epidemic, the public are increasingly concerned about environmental hygiene issues such as misconnection and dilapidation of the drainage pipes of buildings. I will earmark $1 billion to provide subsidies for owners of more than 3 000 old buildings with relatively low rateable values to carry out drainage repair or enhancement works. For buildings with owners having difficulties in organising the works by themselves, such as ""three-nil"" buildings, the Buildings Department will exercise its power under the Buildings Ordinance to carry out the works in default of their owners in an orderly manner based on the risk profile. The owners concerned may also benefit from the subsidy scheme.', '(a)reducing salaries tax and tax under personal assessment for the year of assessment 2020/21 by 100 per cent, subject to a ceiling of $10,000. The reduction will be reflected in the final tax payable for the year of assessment 2020/21. This will benefit 1.87 million taxpayers and reduce government revenue by $11.4 billion;(b)providing rates concession for domestic properties for four quarters of 2021-22, subject to a ceiling of $1,500 per quarter in the first two quarters and a ceiling of $1,000 per quarter in the remaining two quarters for each rateable property. This proposal is estimated to involve 2.95 million domestic properties and reduce government revenue by $11.6 billion;(c)granting each residential electricity account a subsidy of $1,000. This measure will involve an expenditure of about $2.8 billion and benefit over 2.7 million eligible residential households;(d)providing an allowance to eligible social security recipients, equal to one half of a month of the standard rate Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) payments, Old Age Allowance, Old Age Living Allowance or Disability Allowance. This will involve additional expenditure of $2,382 million. Similar arrangements will apply to recipients of the Working Family Allowance and Individual-based Work Incentive Transport Subsidy, involving additional expenditure of $121 million; and(e)paying the examination fees for school candidates sitting for the 2022 Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination, incurring $150 million.']"
8,Reviving the Economy after the Epidemic,"['Reviving theEconomy after the Epidemic', '38.While having a profound impact on the global economic development and structure, as well as people\'s lifestyles, the epidemic has also created new business opportunities. To enable our economy to revive after the epidemic, we should adopt a targeted approach. Apart from helping enterprises adapt to the economic ""new normal"" after the epidemic and stimulating consumption, we should also promote our advantages outside Hong Kong. I will elaborate on the relevant measures in the ensuing parts of my speech.']"
9,Digital Economy,"['Digital Economy', '39.Many traditional industries have accelerated the application of technology in their operations due to the epidemic. Examples include digital payment; smart self-service systems; and various online businesses, customer services and workflow management. For many people who stay at home during the epidemic, the use of online shopping services, video streaming platforms and online conference software has become their new mode of working, studying and entertainment. For various trades, it has now become a trend to speed up digital transformation in order to adapt to the new consumption modes and habits of the people. Only by making good use of information technology can enterprises seize the opportunities of development when the epidemic is over.', '40.In view of the above, we have launched the Distance Business Programme under the AEF to provide funding support for enterprises to adopt information technology solutions and cover the expenses for providing relevant training to their employees. The programme has received an overwhelming response since its launch in mid-2020, and a total funding of nearly $800 million has been granted. We have subsequently allocated an additional funding of $1 billion for the continuation of the programme and further enhancement.', '41.The challenges posed by the epidemic have also catalysed local I&T development. They not only incentivise businesses to conduct research and development (R&D) for products or innovative services but also provide enterprises with suitable contexts for application. The electronic wristbands used for home confinement and the touchless lift button system are some good examples. The Government will continue to support enterprises or manufacturers through, among others, the Public Sector Trial Scheme, the Technology Voucher Programme and the Re-industrialisation Funding Scheme in realising and commercialising their R&D outcomes, using technological services to improve their productivity or business processes, and setting up smart production lines in Hong Kong. This will enable them to better grasp the opportunities brought by the new economy.', ""42.I will allocate a total of $375 million to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) in three years starting from 2021- 22 for developing virtual platforms to enhance its capability to organise online activities and to proceed with digitalisation. Moreover, the TDC will promote Hong Kong's strength in the development of the GBA and in healthcare products and services. It will also explore the use of its physical and online Business- to- Consumer platforms to assist young business starters in promoting their original products and gauging the preference of consumers. "", '43.In light of the epidemic, we have expedited our work in taking forward e-Government by providing more electronic services to make it easier for enterprises and individuals to submit applications, make payments, obtain licences and use government services. By mid-2022, unless there are legal or operational constraints, all government forms and licence applications can be submitted electronically. Besides, eâ€‘payment options (including the Faster Payment System) will be available for making payments in respect of most government bills and licences starting from mid-2022.', '44.The ""iAM Smart"", a one-stop personalised digital service platform, was launched at the end of last year. The HKMA is currently working with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) to develop the business version of the ""iAM Smart"" digital authentication platform. It can be used to authenticate the identity of enterprises through an electronic channel. With the wide adoption of ""iAM Smart"" in various electronic government services, members of the public can choose to obtain their data kept by individual government departments via electronic means, and submit such data electronically when applying for services from financial institutions. In addition, the HKMA has earlier announced the development of ""Commercial Data Interchange"", which will allow commercial services operators to submit customers\' data to financial institutions under the instruction and consent of their corporate customers so as to assist them in the application for services.', ""45.To promote the LawTech development, I set aside funding in the 2019-20 Budget to support the development of an online dispute resolution and deal making platform by a non-governmental organisation (NGO). With an allocation of $100 million to the project, starting from this year, the platform will roll out negotiation, arbitration, mediation and online training services progressively and develop other services such as e-translation and smart contract in phases.

We will continue to improve the facilities along hiking trails to develop more green tourism resources. The purpose is to offer leisure and travel experience with rich historical and cultural elements to both locals and visitors.', '49.I will also earmark $765 million to support the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) in reviving our tourism industry. The HKTB has launched promotional programmes such as ""Holiday at Home"" and ""360 Hong Kong Moments"" with a view to enhancing local ambience and consumption as well as maintaining the promotion and exposure of Hong Kong in visitor source markets. Upon gradual resumption of cross-boundary travel, the HKTB will roll out promotional offers to attract visitors through the ""Open House Hong Kong"" platform.

Over the past many years, we have been utilising our advantages in institution, talents and external connections, and served as a bridge between our country and the rest of the world in different ways in response to our country\'s ever-changing needs. By doing so, Hong Kong has contributed to national development and at the same time promoted its own development and economic growth. Only by making good use of the advantages of ""One Country, Two Systems"" with the precondition of strengthening national security can we continue to play and even enhance our role on this front.', '54.Over the past two years, Hong Kong has been affected by the deterioration of the China-US relations, and experienced the blow from the social incidents and the ravages of the pandemic. However, we should not let these challenges weaken our confidence in the future. Instead, we should learn from the experience and make correct assessment of the major development trends.', ""55.First, the world is facing profound changes unseen in a century. The economic gravity is shifting from West to East, and the political setting has also seen subtle changes. Our country's composite national strength has enhanced significantly, while other developing countries in Asia have undergone robust development. However, with the rise of unilateralism in recent years and the misunderstandings of some western countries towards Hong Kong's developments, we are facing greater difficulties. The epidemic has increased various countries' concerns about development security, which might further escalate protectionism. Some nations encourage or even ask enterprises to move back to their home countries, impacting on the development and setting of global value chains."", ""56.Second, the world is facing drastic disruptions brought by technological revolution, which have far-reaching implications for our personal life, modes of production and operation, economic structures, development prospects and international landscape. The pandemic has also accelerated changes in the mode of business operation and people's living habits. Making good use of digital technology is not only essential to effective business operation, but also crucial for preventing and combating the pandemic and protecting public health and safety. Whether a place can attain a leading position in I&T will determine its success or failure. "", '57.Third, green development is a major global trend. Environmental pollution and climate change have become too serious to ignore. There is a general recognition in the international community that we should promote green and low-carbon development, which involves extensive new areas. The Government needs to have visions and determination; the people need to build awareness of environmental protection and corresponding habits; the business sector needs to develop and adopt novel technologies, and launch products of high efficiency. Other matching services such as financial support are also needed.', '58.Fourth, as for Hong Kong, we have experienced many changes at different points in our history, but the support of our country has remained unchanged.

The ageing population also poses pressure on public expenditure. Though I have great confidence in Hong Kong's fundamental strengths and long-term prospects, we must, in the face of an economic downturn and the aforesaid challenges, exercise extra prudence in managing public finance."", ""165.Our fiscal reserves are the fruits of the economic development of Hong Kong and the hard work of our people over the years. They enable us to adopt a deficit budget amid the prevailing economic downturn and launch counter-cyclical measures to support the economy and relieve people's burden. In the past year, we have increased government expenditure substantially to combat the epidemic and roll out relief measures, which resulted in our fiscal reserves dropping sharply in two years from the equivalent of 23 months of government expenditure to 13 months."", '166.Although I forecast an improvement in revenue for the next financial year, I expect that the fiscal deficit will be $101.6 billion, accounting for 3.6 per cent of GDP, due to the counter-cyclical fiscal measures and the continued increase in recurrent expenditure. In other words, Hong Kong will record a deficit for a number of years after achieving a surplus for 15 years. As shown in the Medium Range Forecast (MRF), the Operating Account is projected to be in deficit for five consecutive years. The operating deficit for 2021-22 will be more than $140 billion mainly due to the counter-cyclical measures while the operating deficit for the remaining four years will range from $22.4 billion to $40.7 billion. The Consolidated Account is also expected to record a deficit for four consecutive years. The above forecast has not yet taken into account any tax rebate or relief measure that the Government may implement in the future. ', '167.The deficits are mainly caused by the fact that the rise in government expenditure is outpacing the increase in government revenue, especially in terms of recurrent expenditure. Recurrent expenditure of the Government increased from about $150 billion in 1997-98 to about $470 billion in 2020-21, representing a more than three-fold increase. The significant rise in government expenditure in recent years is for enhancing services or investing for the future. However, as emphasised in my last Budget, government expenditure should enter a consolidation period, and the long-term financial commitments should also be commensurate with the increase in revenue.', ""168.As a number of measures announced in this year's Budget will have a bearing on the new financial year and the MRF, I would like to offer some explanations here."", '169.To optimise the use of fiscal reserves for seeking a better return to meet future needs, the Government set up the Future Fund in 2016 to make longer-term investments for a period of ten years. The investment return of the Fund forms an integral part of public financial resources, and has accumulated a return amounting to nearly $100 billion. While the Government has all along been disclosing the rate of return of the Future Fund, the investment return yet to be brought back has not been reflected under the cash-based government accounts. Starting from 2021-22, I will reflect the cumulative investment return of the Fund in the Operating Account on a progressive basis, with $25 billion brought back in the first year.', ""170.The 2021-22 Budget has also included $23 billion brought back from the Housing Reserve and the annual proceeds of about $35 billion from the expansion of the Government Green Bond Programme as mentioned earlier. The sums raised under the Government Green Bond Programme will provide funding for green projects under the Capital Works Reserve Fund but will not be used to finance operating expenditure, and hence will not undermine public finance discipline. The issuance of bonds cannot bolster our real financial strength as it ultimately requires the repayment of principal and interest. Nonetheless, the issuance of additional green bonds for financing eligible projects can definitely relieve the Government's fiscal pressure arising from the need to use existing resources to meet capital expenditure. This is a reasonable and appropriate approach in the light of the current low interest rate environment, and is also conducive to the development of Hong Kong's bond market. "", ""171.The above measures of bringing back the Future Fund's investment return and the Housing Reserve and issuing additional green bonds will ensure that our fiscal reserves can be maintained at a relatively robust level despite deficit budgets in the next few years. They would enhance confidence in Hong Kong's fiscal strength and is conducive to maintaining our financial stability. However, in the long run, the key to maintaining healthy public finances is to follow the principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenue and ensure that the growth of expenditure is commensurate with economic growth. In the face of the challenges of fiscal deficits, we should not only reduce expenditure but also increase revenue.""]"

Last year, Hong Kong's economy was battered by the epidemic, and all sectors of the community were generally affected in varying degrees, particularly the grassroots. Despite the fiscal deficit, I have decided not to reduce our spending in areas related to people's livelihood, especially resources allocated to the three policy areas of education, social welfare and healthcare, in order to safeguard people's livelihood and maintain public confidence. In 2021-22, the recurrent funding for these three policy areas amounts to $302.3 billion in total, accounting for 58 per cent of the Government's total estimated recurrent expenditure and representing an increase of 45 per cent over the provision of $208.2 billion in 2017-18."", '173.The Government will set an example by cutting expenditure so as to strengthen fiscal discipline. In 2021-22, we will have zero growth in the civil service establishment. Besides, the Government will implement an expenditure reduction programme by requiring all policy bureaux and departments to reduce expenditure without affecting livelihood-related spending. The objective is to trim recurrent expenditure by one per cent in 2022-23. The estimated savings will be about $3.9 billion. While it seems not too difficult to achieve the one per cent cut in recurrent expenditure, there is limited room for curbing expenses related to personal emoluments which account for about 60 per cent of recurrent expenditure of government departments. We can only achieve the target mainly through savings from the remaining 40 per cent of recurrent expenditure, including major items such as general expenses and subventions. All departments have to undertake critical review, adjust priorities and enhance efficiency in order to achieve the savings target without affecting day-to-day operation and the public services they provide.

Nevertheless, we will keep in view the situation and make adjustments at the appropriate time.', '178.During Budget consultations, I received many proposals to introduce new taxes. If we do so, we have to carefully examine the proposals, take all factors into consideration, and earnestly listen to views of various sectors of the community.

At the same time, the Government has been collecting views from stakeholders in the business sector. Taking into account the preliminary views of the Advisory Panel, I would like to outline the direction of the Government's response measures so that the business sector can have a better grasp of the issue and make early preparation. First, as an international financial and business centre, Hong Kong will actively implement the BEPS 2.0 proposals according to international consensus. Second, as most of the rules under BEPS 2.0 are only applicable to large multinational corporations, we will minimise the impact on local SMEs where possible when drawing up the response measures and strive to maintain the simplicity, certainty and fairness of our tax regime, which are our key advantages. Third, while safeguarding Hong Kong's taxing rights, we will at the same time minimise the compliance burden on affected corporations. Fourth, we will keep up our efforts in improving Hong Kong's business environment and enhancing our competitiveness, with a view to attracting multinational corporations to invest and operate in Hong Kong.

We will review the case for introducing a progressive element to the rating system and that for providing rates concession to owner-occupied properties on a regular basis.

Revenue from profits tax is $131 billion, comparable to the original estimate. Meanwhile, revenue from salaries tax is $72 billion, which is $12.1 billion higher than the original estimate. This is mainly because some tax revenue that should be received in the previous year could only be collected in this year as a result of the deferred tax assessment cycle.

Recurrent expenditure in these three areas recorded a cumulative increase of 53 per cent over the past five years.', '190.Our target is to have zero growth in the civil service establishment in 2021-22. The Civil Service Bureau has encouraged departments to enhance effectiveness through re-prioritisation, internal redeployment and streamlining of work processes, so as to cope with the workload. ']"
61,Medium Range Forecast,"['Medium RangeForecast', '191.The MRF projects, mainly from a macro perspective, the revenue and expenditure as well as financial position of the Government. From 2022-23 to 2025-26, a real economic growth rate of 3.3 per cent is adopted for the MRF.', '192.During the above period, the average annual capital works expenditure will exceed $100 billion, while the growth of recurrent government expenditure ranges between 3.5 per cent and 4.7 per cent per annum.', '193.Regarding revenue from land premium, the forecast from 2022-23 onwards is based on the average proportion of revenue from land premium to GDP over the past 15 years, which is 3.6 per cent of GDP. I also assume that the growth rate of revenue from profits tax and other taxes will correspond to the economic growth rate in the next few years.', '194.In addition, the MRF reflects the bringing back of the Housing Reserve and the investment return of the Future Fund, and the proceeds of the Government Green Bond Programme.', '195.Based on the above assumptions and arrangements, I forecast an annual deficit in the Operating Account in each of the coming five financial years, as well as a deficit in the Capital Account from 2022-23 to 2024-25. The estimated deficit in the Operating Account in 2021-22 is mainly due to the expenditure arising from the one-off relief measures announced in this Budget and some of the relief measures announced last year. The forecast deficit in the Operating Account in the following four years is attributed to the fact that recurrent expenditure will be higher than revenue receipts. The above forecast has not taken into account any tax rebate or relief measure that the Government may implement over these four years. ', '196.Fiscal reserves are estimated at $775.8 billion by the end of March 2026, representing 22 per cent of GDP, or equivalent to 12 months of government expenditure.']"
62,Concluding Remarks,"['ConcludingRemarks', '197.Mr President, over the past two years, Hong Kong has suffered successive setbacks. And now we have to fight the epidemic and ride out the economic difficulties. Life has not been easy for us all.', ""198.I often chat with people, especially during the preparation for the Budget. I know how difficult it is to earn a living during the economic downturn. I can feel their pain. This is why, despite a record high fiscal deficit in 2020-21, I once again propose a Budget involving a deficit of over a hundred billion dollars. I do so after careful consideration, as the counter-cyclical measures are necessary for stabilising the economy and alleviating people's burden. At the same time, I am mindful of the need to expand government revenue and create fiscal space in a prudent manner."", '199.In spite of the pressure we now face, looking back, we have walked all the way through thick and thin. However harsh life may have been, Hong Kong remains the home that we treasure. ', '200.Home is not where we find perfection. It is where we stay together as a family, sharing mutual care, acceptance and support.', '201.This unprecedented pandemic reminds us that we are all in the same boat. Deep-seated conflicts cannot be resolved instantly, nor can wounds be healed overnight. Given time, even the tightest knot can be untied. ', '202.The economy may move in a cycle, but there is always a way to prosperity. We have overcome many challenges and always come out stronger. Let us be steadfast and ride out the storm. Together we will build a better Hong Kong.', '203.Thank you, Mr President.']"
