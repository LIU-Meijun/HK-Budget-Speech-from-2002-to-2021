0,Introduction,"['Mr President, HonourableMembers and fellow citizens,', 'I move that the Appropriation Bill 2017 be read a second time.', 'Introduction', ""2.When I took over as the Financial Secretary on 16 January this year, the foremost task before me was to prepare the Budget for the coming financial year. I kept asking myself - What does Hong Kong need most now? What are citizens' expectations of the Government? What is our ideal way of life? How can we attain a sense of well-being? How do we position Hong Kong as an international city?"", '3.I came from a poor family and grew up in the 1960s and 1970s when people in Hong Kong were, in general, happy and satisfied with their lives as long as they had a shelter and got enough to eat and wear. Hong Kong then saw brisk economic growth in the 1980s and 1990s and after that, two financial crises. I believe that having gone through these changes, Hong Kong people now crave for more than the basic necessities. We all want further progress in society, so that young people can cherish hopes for the future, the middle-aged need not worry about the competitiveness of the younger generation, and the elderly will have no fear of abandonment.', '4.It is not beyond our capacity to realise this vision for Hong Kong, but I dare not boast that we can open up a new world for Hong Kong by one Budget alone. My endeavour is to make use of the wealth we have accumulated together through hard work to take care of the needy in the society, ease the heavy burden of middle-class families, and make appropriate investments essential for building a better Hong Kong.', '5.I understand that people from all walks of life have different expectations of the Budget and hope the Government can respond to their demands. However, the reality is that resources are not unlimited, and that no Budget can ever meet the needs of each and every member of the community and win applause from all. We can only devote our best efforts to provide support for those in need, share wealth with the community when there is a substantial surplus and allocate resources to areas which are conducive to our social and economic development.', '6.In the coming year, our economy will be fraught with uncertainties arising from the complicated and volatile external environment. I hope that with wisdom, collaboration and relentless efforts, we will have the strength to rise to all challenges ahead and embrace the future with hope.']"
1,Economic Performance in 2016,"['Economic Performance in 2016', ""7.The global economy operated in low gear in 2016 and recorded the slowest growth since the global financial crisis. The situation was particularly grim at the beginning of the year, affecting the trade performance of Hong Kong and the Asian region. The subsequent abatement of downward pressures on the external front led to a rebound in Hong Kong's exports of goods, registering a year-on-year growth of 1.7 per cent in real terms for 2016 as a whole. Exports of services, though showing some relative improvement during the year and picking up in the fourth quarter, still fell by 3.1 per cent for the whole year. With the gradual recovery of tourism, the decline in the overall retail sales volume slowed notably to only 3.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, but for the whole year it was still down by 7.1 per cent."", '8.Domestic demand strengthened in the latter half of last year. Favourable employment and earnings conditions, together with the support of relief measures introduced in the last Budget, were conducive to sanguine consumer sentiment. The growth of private consumption expenditure gathered pace in the second half of last year, and investment expenditure also bounced back visibly.', ""9.Overall, the local economy picked up progressively from a marginal growth rate of one per cent in the first quarter to 3.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. For 2016 as a whole, there was a modest growth of 1.9 per cent, generally in line with the one to two per cent economic growth as forecast in last year's Budget."", ""10.The unemployment rate averaged 3.4 per cent last year, sustaining a state of full employment in general. Inflation pressure was moderate. The headline inflation rate for 2016 was 2.4 per cent. Netting out the effects of the Government's one-off measures, the underlying inflation rate was 2.3 per cent in 2016, the fifth consecutive year of easing.""]"
2,Economic Outlook for 2017,"['Economic Outlook for 2017', '11.Looking ahead, in 2017, the economic growth of advanced economies will be modest and patchy. This, coupled with new uncertainties brought about by political changes in many parts of the world and rising populist and protectionist sentiments, will further complicate the situation and render the global economic outlook volatile.', '12.The US economy has continued to improve in the recent period but the economic policy agenda of the new administration has remained unclear. Despite the fact that the US may introduce fiscal stimulus measures conducive to global economic growth, there is increasing market concern over whether the US will roll out, in phases, a number of trade protection measures, which may disrupt the improving growth momentum in global trade. The Federal Reserve Board (Fed) will proceed with or even expedite the normalisation of US interest rates. Consequently, monetary policy divergence among major central banks will become more pronounced. All these will impact on the global economy and financial environment.', '13.Economic growth in Europe is still constrained by its structural debts. This, together with the Brexit developments and the upcoming general elections in some major European countries this year, will complicate and add uncertainties to the political and economic outlook for Europe. This may weigh on the European economy as well as global monetary and financial stability.', '14.The growth of the Mainland economy is increasingly driven by domestic demand and the service sector, and is moving towards a pattern of sustainable development. With stable and appreciable economic growth as well as ample policy room, the Mainland economy should be able to maintain a medium-high pace of growth, remaining a mainstay supporting global economic growth.', ""15.Japan's economy has been stuck in low gear, facing high deflation risks. A package of fiscal stimulus and monetary initiatives has been launched but the effectiveness is yet to be seen."", '16.As regards emerging markets, international energy and metal prices have rebounded from the low level over the recent past, easing the downward pressure on commodity-exporting economies. Emerging markets in Asia will remain the main propellers of global economic growth.', ""17.The slightly improved global economy over the recent period will lend support to Hong Kong's export performance. If the recent growth momentum continues, our merchandise exports will see a stronger performance this year. However, the aforesaid risk factors in the external environment will cast shadows over the export trade in Asia and in Hong Kong. Under these circumstances, sustaining domestic demand will remain crucial to maintaining the stable development of our economy and underpinning the employment market. Moreover, inbound tourism has improved recently, with fresh growth in the number of visitors. If this continues, the retail sector should be set to stabilise further."", '18.Locally, favourable conditions in the job market and rising labour earnings have bolstered consumer confidence in the recent past. Sustained increases in infrastructure and other building and construction activities should provide momentum for domestic demand. In the light of the recent developments and granting no severe external shocks, I forecast Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of two to three per cent in 2017.', '19.But, the uncertain external environment and interest rate trend may trigger abrupt shifts in capital flows and heighten volatility in local asset prices, with repercussions on consumption and investment sentiments and on macro-economic stability. Over the past few years, the tight supply of residential flats, ultra-low interest rates and an influx of capital have made the local property market even more exuberant, resulting in high flat prices which are out of tune with the local economy.', ""20.The current-term Government is committed to increasing land and housing supply, and has introduced several rounds of demand-side management measures and macro-prudential policies. These efforts have effectively maintained the overall macro-economic and financial stability. The introduction of the Special Stamp Duty and Buyer's Stamp Duty, together with the earlier increase in Ad Valorem Stamp Duty, has achieved significant results in combating short-term speculation, curbing external demand and reducing investment demand. Moreover, with the Government's strenuous efforts in increasing land supply in the past few years and the gradual completion of housing units, we expect that the supply of residential flats will increase substantially in the next few years. However, the property market may have to face potential risks if the Fed normalises interest rates faster this year. We will closely monitor the situation."", '21.The still-low global inflation and strong US dollar have lessened the impact of the rise in international oil prices, maintaining imported inflation at a low level. Inflationary pressure will remain mild in the short term. I forecast that the headline inflation rate for 2017 as a whole will be 1.8 per cent with an underlying inflation rate at two per cent.']"
3,Public Finance : Objectives and Approach,"['Public Finance : Objectives and Approach', '22.Hong Kong is one of the most advanced economies in the world, despite the relatively small scale of our economy. Our GDP per capita has now reached US$44,000, overtaking Japan and many advanced economies in Europe. Hong Kong\'s success is built on the resilience, hard work and sustained innovative efforts of past generations. Our achievements are also attributable to the unique advantage of ""one country, two systems"", the fair and corruption-free system, rule of law, and the open and efficient market that we have. I believe that while recognising the effect of market forces, the Government should play an active role as a facilitator by taking forward appropriate policies with the optimal use of public resources. Only by doing so can we build a caring, just and pluralistic society, helping Hong Kong develop as an even more liveable, sustainable and vibrant city.']"
4,Developing the Economy and Improving Livelihood,"['Developing the Economy and Improving Livelihood', ""23.Specifically, public finance should serve three objectives. First, the Government must be appropriately proactive in developing the economy and improving people's livelihood. We must strengthen the competitiveness of and explore new markets for the pillar industries. We must also help industries over which we have advantages as well as emerging industries and identify growth opportunities so that the economy can prosper in a sustained and diversified manner. I believe that, as long as all industries can continue to grow and flourish, young people will have better job opportunities, greater upward mobility as well as a platform to realise their dreams. Only by giving the younger generation hope for the future can our city remain vibrant, joyful and positive."", ""24.Whatever is taken from the people ought to be used for the people. The Government must uphold the principle of people-based governance. Government resources should primarily be used to improve people's livelihood and cater for the needy groups in the community. Given limited resources, it is not possible to meet all livelihood-related policy objectives at one stroke. We must allocate resources according to need and priority, striking a balance between the desired policy outcome and the affordability of the Government and progress towards our goals at a measured pace.""]"
5,Investing for the Future and Enhancing Liveability,"['Investing for the Future and Enhancing Liveability', '25.Second, the Government must be forward-looking and invest continuously for the future of Hong Kong. We should create capacity for both development and environment, and enhance competitiveness, so that our economy and society can develop in a sustained manner and our living environment can keep improving.', ""26.With respect to hardware, the Government has kept investing in infrastructure, including land production and expansion of the air, sea and land transport networks, to support our social and economic development. The Government's annual expenditure on capital works projects has increased significantly from a mere $62.4 billion in 2012-13 to $86.8 billion in 2017-18, allowing the construction industry to contribute 4.7 per cent to our GDP. I wish to point out that, other than improving people's quality of life and enhancing our business environment, these projects have created tens of thousands of jobs for the construction industry, transport industry and other trades."", ""27.Human capital is Hong Kong's most important asset. In the face of stiff competition from other economies and a new economic landscape arising from technological development, we must continue to invest heavily in nurturing talent for a knowledge-based economy and promote diversified and high value-added economic development for Hong Kong. The current-term Government has made significant efforts to promote Innovation and Technology (I&T). These include establishing the Innovation and Technology Bureau in November 2015, allocating over $18 billion so far to enhance our I&T ecosystem, providing funding support for universities and the industry to conduct research and development (R&D) activities and supporting start-ups."", ""28.To improve people's quality of life, the Government is committed to developing Hong Kong into a smart city by leveraging I&T to enhance city management. We have commenced a comprehensive study to formulate the policy objectives and a blueprint for developing Hong Kong into a smart city."", '29.The Government will continue to invest substantially to protect and enhance our environment, striving to further improve the air quality, water quality, green and blue assets and waste management; and step up efforts to combat climate change and conserve nature, thereby making Hong Kong an even more liveable city.']"
6,Upholding Social Justice and SharingFruits of Success,"['Upholding Social Justice and SharingFruits of Success', '30.Third, the Government must make good use of financial resources, with a view to building a fair and just society where people from all walks of life can share the fruits of economic advancement. Some low income earners still find it hard to make ends meet, reflecting a notable wealth gap in society.', ""31.Poverty alleviation, care for the elderly and support for the disadvantaged are at the top of the current-term Government's agenda. We have devoted substantial resources to improve the livelihood of the grassroots over the past four years or so. Specifically, as compared with the amount at the beginning of the current-term Government, recurrent expenditure on social welfare has increased by 71 per cent in five years, from $42.8 billion in 2012-13 to $73.3 billion in 2017-18. Over the period, poverty figures have edged downward. We will continue to allocate resources in this area. We aim to render assistance to people in need through our social security system, while at the same time striving to encourage and support people capable of working to achieve self-reliance through employment. The goal is to alleviate intergenerational poverty and enhance upward social mobility, thereby promoting a caring and inclusive society."", ""32.Senior citizens deserve credit for their contributions to the prosperity of Hong Kong. We should show the community's care for them."", ""33.As announced by the Chief Executive in this year's Policy Address, the Government will enhance the Old Age Living Allowance (OALA) through two measures. First, a higher monthly allowance of $3,435 will be provided for eligible elderly persons with more financial needs. Second, the existing asset limits will be relaxed to benefit more elderly persons. It is estimated that about 500 000 elderly persons, each receiving approximately $10,000 to $30,000 more a year, will benefit from these measures in the first year upon full implementation, and the coverage of OALA will increase from 37 per cent to 47 per cent of the elderly population, thus further strengthening retirement protection through the social security pillar. The Government will lower the eligibility age for Elderly Health Care Vouchers from 70 to 65, so that about 400 000 more elderly persons will receive $2,000 a year to purchase primary care services from the private sector. These measures represent a significant and long-term commitment, involving an additional recurrent government expenditure of about $9 billion per year on average over the next ten years."", '34.The Government is discussing with major stakeholders the proposal to progressively abolish the ""offsetting"" of severance payments or long service payments with Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) contributions. I will provide the necessary financial support having regard to the outcome.', '35.Besides, I will continue to allocate resources to optimise healthcare and elderly services, and enhance care and support for persons with disabilities.']"
7,A Sound and Progressive Fiscal Policy,"['A Sound and Progressive Fiscal Policy', ""36.Mr President, in preparing this Budget, I have carefully considered the views of different sectors and note some gaps in the understanding of the Government's fiscal position. Please allow me an opportunity to offer some clarifications and suggest policy approaches, taking into account the three objectives of public finance, the macro-economic outlook and the Government's financial position."", 'Annual Surplus', ""37.Some sectors have suggested that since we are running a substantial fiscal surplus this year, the Government should reduce taxes and introduce more recurrent measures to alleviate people's financial burden."", ""38.As we all know, Hong Kong has a narrow tax base, and our revenue sources are concentrated. Profits tax, salaries tax, stamp duties, rates and land revenue account for about 75 per cent of total government revenue in 2015-16. Nevertheless, as a small and open economy, Hong Kong is particularly susceptible to global economic fluctuations, which is beyond the Government's control. Should there be any abrupt deterioration or fluctuation in the external economic environment, government revenue would be directly affected, and the consequences could be unpredictable. Analysis based on statistics over the past 25 years shows that although government revenue has grown broadly in line with the GDP, the former is often far more volatile than the latter. This has brought challenges to our public finances. Take this year as an example. The vast majority of the Government's surplus comes from the far higher-than-expected land revenue and stamp duties on properties. Our property market has experienced a market boom of nearly eight years. Property prices are still at a record high though trading in the market has turned quieter. Supply of private residential flats in the future is expected to gradually pick up to an average of nearly 20 000 units a year. It is difficult to tell whether revenue from land sales in the future will continue to hit successive new highs. In fact, over the past decade, land revenue varied considerably from a low level of less than $17 billion in 2008-09 to over $117 billion in 2016-17."", '39.Government revenue may fluctuate with the ups and downs of the economic cycle. Government expenditure, however, is far more rigid and public services cannot be trimmed or suspended arbitrarily. The current-term Government has introduced many new measures on poverty alleviation and support for the disadvantaged, such as the OALA and the Low-income Working Family Allowance (LIFA). To keep pace with the rapid ageing of our population, financial commitment on associated measures will increase at a fast rate. Take the Public Transport Fare Concession Scheme for the Elderly and Eligible Persons with Disabilities (also known as the ""$2 Public Transport Fare Concession Scheme"") and the Elderly Health Care Voucher Scheme as examples. Between 2012-13 and 2017-18, recurrent expenditure on the two schemes would see an over four-fold and ten-fold increase to nearly $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion respectively, representing a sharp growth. These are measures that benefit our community; cuts or cancellation cannot be taken lightly.', '40.Being a responsible government, we should remain vigilant. Before committing to new recurrent initiatives, we must be satisfied that these initiatives can be funded in a sustainable manner in the long run. Windfall revenue of a capital nature is no justification for substantial increases in recurrent expenditure. It is much the same as an employee who may happily spend a bit more upon receiving a large sum of year-end bonus in a certain year but would not recklessly make any unaffordable long-term financial commitment. So, in my view, in considering how our annual surplus is to be deployed, we should take into account the source and nature of the surplus, alongside the prevailing economic situation and external environment, the future needs of society and the expectations of the community, so as to ensure optimal allocation of resources.', 'Fiscal Reserves', ""41.It has also been suggested that the fiscal reserves of over $900 billion is just too much, and instead of being miserly, the Government should consider major tax cuts and step up its efforts to relieve people's hardship. While I share the view that the Government, with its existing fiscal strength, can afford to be more proactive, we should avoid reckless commitments. Public spending must be fit for purpose."", '42.Article 107 of the Basic Law stipulates that ""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall follow the principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues in drawing up its budget, and strive to achieve a fiscal balance, avoid deficits and keep the budget commensurate with the growth rate of its gross domestic product"". I agree that the implementation of this Article should not be a ""straitjacket"" which restrains our annual revenue and expenditure. Instead, there should be a certain degree of flexibility. In fact, Hong Kong, as a small externally-oriented economy, is highly susceptible to the influence of the external environment and cyclical fluctuations, and short-term fiscal imbalance is probably inevitable. Some expenditure increases are justifiable, as in the case of welfare spending since the Government is catching up on service delivery. Some other expenditure items are investments and the potential return may only be realised in future. I consider that it is most important to spend only when necessary and to act with prudence and strive for an overall fiscal balance over time.', '43.The total expenditure of the Government has increased year after year from $380 billion in 2012-13 to over $490 billion in 2017-18. Total and recurrent expenditure of the current-term Government would have respectively grown on average by 5.4 per cent and as much as 7.2 per cent per annum between 2012-13 and 2017-18. Compared with the nominal GDP growth of five per cent and government revenue growth of 3.4 per cent for the same period, expenditure growth of the current-term Government is considerable. However, the growth of government expenditure cannot keep outpacing economic growth for an undue period, lest the risk of a structural deficit would emerge.', '44.In assessing whether the level of fiscal reserves is appropriate, we ought to consider the Government\'s prevailing recurrent funding requirements and the medium- to long-term financial implications upon full implementation of policy initiatives, such as the ""$2 Public Transport Fare Concession Scheme"" and the Elderly Health Care Voucher Scheme mentioned in paragraph 39, and the enhanced OALA and the provision of subsidy in respect of the MPF ""offsetting"" arrangement as announced in this year\'s Policy Address. In addition, our medium and long-term commitments include a sum of over $300 billion for ongoing works projects and about $450 billion for civil service pension obligations in the next ten years. The Government\'s financial burden cannot be taken lightly.', ""45.To demonstrate the Government's determination in and commitment to making good use of surplus and investing in the future, we have set aside substantial resources for housing and healthcare. The Housing Reserve, which was established in 2014 to support large-scale public housing development programme, now stands at $77 billion. Last year, the Government also set aside $200 billion for the implementation of a ten-year hospital development plan to improve public healthcare facilities and services. I will make provisions for elderly services and rehabilitation services for persons with disabilities as well as sports development when determining the use of surplus for this financial year."", ""46.The economic crises caused by the financial plight of many European countries and the US in the past decade have pointed to pitfalls that Hong Kong should avoid. In fact, from 1998 to 2004 when Hong Kong's economy was ensnared in difficulties during the Asian Financial Crisis and the I&T bubble burst, government revenue plunged far more sharply than that of GDP. We experienced five years of fiscal deficits, which depleted 40 per cent or over $180 billion of our fiscal reserves, leaving these at a level equivalent to only 13 months instead of 28 months of government spending."", ""47.I believe that the two objectives of our fiscal policy are maintaining healthy public finances and strengthening resilience to withstand economic fluctuations. We should not just keep looking back to the prosperous years in the past. Instead, we should stay alert to the challenges ahead. Under the linked exchange rate system, there is very limited room to adjust our monetary policy. Therefore, we have to rely on a sound and progressive fiscal policy to ensure that we can stay strong and have adequate resources to continuously increase public investment, enhance our competitiveness, cater for social development needs and improve people's livelihood. This also enables us to promptly launch counter-cyclical measures to stabilise the economy in times of economic downturn, so as to minimise the impact of economic fluctuations on people's livelihood."", '48.Our position as an international financial centre is crucial to both Hong Kong and our country. The cornerstone of financial stability is confidence. A sound financial management philosophy and strong fiscal position of the Government are vital for maintaining international confidence in Hong Kong. We may recall how a single financial crisis has exposed the excessive budget deficits in many advanced economies in Europe and the US. A domino effect was triggered off, bringing down the international ratings of all these economies, and giving them a hard blow to their economies and financial systems. With these examples, Hong Kong must reflect on our own position seriously. Hong Kong has recently been recognised by the International Monetary Fund again for our strong policy framework, including the linked exchange rate system, vigorous regulation and supervision of the financial system and ample buffers, which enable us to cope with external economic risks.', '49.As such, we should spend only when necessary and make good use of the reserves to benefit the society. At the same time, we must maintain strict fiscal discipline and ensure that our expenditure growth will be broadly in line with affordability. We must also maintain adequate fiscal reserves to support socio-economic development, deal with emergencies and cope with the challenges posed by a rapidly ageing population.', 'Value for Money and User Pays Principles', '50.To achieve more efficient use of resources, the Government should adhere to the ""value for money"" principle, rectify unsustainable policies and adjust expenditure items that are repetitive, inappropriate and ineffective. To ensure the effective use of our public resources and to preserve the revenue base, government departments should continue to review their fees and charges in a timely manner and in accordance with the ""cost recovery"" and ""user pays"" principles.', 'Tax Policy', '51.Another topic that people frequently talk about is our tax policy. There have been calls for tax cuts, providing tax concessions to support the development of certain industries and broadening the tax base.', '52.Hong Kong has all along been maintaining a low, simple and territorial-source-based tax regime, which comprises mainly of direct taxes. As an advocate of free trade, Hong Kong does not impose duties on import or export goods except for four types of dutiable commodities. These were the key competitive advantages underpinning our success in the past. However, the global competitive environment is fast-changing. Neighbouring countries, European countries, the US and Free Trade Zones in the Mainland are using tax concession as a means to compete for investment and promote the development of targeted industries. Some countries have even adjusted their taxation structure. Recently, individual European countries and the US indicated that they would consider reducing profits tax in a bid to enhance competitiveness. Besides, the international community is taking forward measures to counter money laundering, tax base erosion and profit shifting. Hong Kong should complement these global efforts. How can we ensure that our competitive advantages would not be undermined?', ""53.With social advancement and economic development, the Government will continue to increase expenditure in social welfare, education, healthcare, housing supply, infrastructure and district facilities, etc. We should be mindful of our narrow tax base, concentration of revenue from a few industries and volatility of Government's revenue in response to economic fluctuations. Using 2015-16 as an example, revenue from land sales and profits tax accounted for 14 per cent and 31 per cent of government revenue respectively, with the financial and real estate industries contributing over 40 per cent of the profits tax receipts. Volatility in the global economy and financial market in the future or significant adjustment in asset prices will affect government revenue and fiscal affordability."", '54.As a responsible government, we have to cope with the huge expenditure needs under different economic scenarios. We cannot propose a tax cut which erodes our revenue base. Neither can we adjust our tax rates frequently as this would affect the predictability of our tax regime and dent investor confidence. We have to examine the international competitiveness of our tax regime and address the problem of a narrow tax base. I plan to set up a tax policy unit in the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau to comprehensively examine these tax issues from a macro perspective. On the one hand, we will seek to align our tax practices with international standards and actively study ways to foster the development of pillar industries, industries over which we have advantages and emerging industries through tax measures including enhanced deductions for I&T expenditure, so as to ensure that Hong Kong remains competitive and can create wealth. On the other hand, we will enhance our tax regime and explore broadening the tax base and increasing revenue, so as to ensure that adequate resources are available to support the sustainable development of our society.']"
8,Revised Estimates for 2016-17,"['Revised Estimates for 2016-17', '55.The 2016-17 revised estimate on government revenue is $559.5 billion, 12 per cent or $61.3 billion higher than the original estimate. This is due mainly to the increase in revenue from land sales and stamp duty.', '56.Revenue from land sales is $50.8 billion or 76 per cent higher than the original estimate, demonstrating yet again that land revenue has always been highly volatile and vulnerable to market fluctuations. It was only in 2015-16, when revenue from land sales was nearly $9.1 billion lower than estimated as some sites were unable to be sold. As a result of a period of hectic trading in the property market last year, stamp duty revenue for the whole year would be $8 billion or 16 per cent higher than estimated.', '57.As for government expenditure, I forecast a revised estimate of $466.7 billion, 4.1 per cent or $20.2 billion lower than the original estimate. This is mainly because the $10 billion set aside for the Hospital Authority Public-Private Partnership Fund in the original estimate was advanced and allocated in 2015-16.', '58.For 2016-17, I forecast a surplus of $92.8 billion. Fiscal reserves are expected to reach $935.7 billion by 31 March 2017.']"

These measures include–"", ""61.In addition to the above one-off measures, I propose, after taking into account the Government's fiscal position in the short to medium term, the following five recurrent tax measures starting from 2017-18 so as to relieve the burden on taxpayers–"", 'Support for Building Rehabilitation', '62.The ageing of buildings is a thorny issue posing health and safety risks for the community. While owners are responsible for timely maintenance of their buildings, many of them find the relevant procedures daunting. To help property owners secure the necessary technical support, the Government will earmark $300 million to allow owners to participate in the ""Smart Tender"" Building Rehabilitation Facilitating Services Scheme run by the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) at a concessionary rate. It is estimated that owners of about 4 500 buildings will benefit from this initiative in the next five years.', '63.This set of tax and short-term relief measures will cost $35.1 billion in total. Together with other spending initiatives in the Budget, they will have a fiscal stimulus effect of boosting GDP for 2017 by 1.1 per cent.', 'Support for Small and Medium Enterprises', '64.The Government has always attached great importance to the development of SMEs and rendered them key assistance in tapping new markets and enhancing overall competitiveness. As the external economic environment is still fraught with uncertainties, we will continue to implement the following three support measures for local SMEs–', '65.It is equally important to support the use of I&T by SMEs to enhance their competiveness. Last November, we introduced the Technology Voucher Programme to provide each eligible SME with funding of up to $200,000. The programme promotes the effective use of technological services and solutions among SMEs for better operational efficiency, and creates business opportunities for the I&T industry. Response has been encouraging with more than 900 SMEs having already registered their intention to participate in the programme.', 'First Registration Tax for Electric Vehicles', '66.For years we have been actively promoting a wider use of electric vehicles to replace diesel and petrol vehicles so as to improve roadside air quality. Relevant measures include the introduction of First Registration Tax exemption for electric vehicles to narrow the price difference between these vehicles and the conventional ones. The waiver arrangement will expire on 31 March this year. In consideration of the overall growth of the private car fleet in recent years and the increasing acceptance of electric private cars by drivers, the Government has decided to revise the arrangement. From 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, First Registration Tax of electric commercial vehicles, motor cycles and motor tricycles will continue to be fully waived. However, the First Registration Tax waiver for electric private cars will be capped at $97,500. The Environment Bureau will announce the details.', 'Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme', '67.To encourage the use of private healthcare services by the public, we will provide tax deduction for the purchase of regulated health insurance products, details of which are being examined by the Government.', 'Use of Surplus', '68.Given the higher-than-expected surplus for this financial year, I will take a forward-looking approach to put $61 billion of the surplus to good use, by implementing the following–', '(a)reducing salaries tax and tax under personal assessment for 2016-17 by 75 per cent, subject to a ceiling of $20,000. The reduction will be reflected in the final tax payable for 2016-17.

A variety of payment options are now available to the public, including mobile payment, peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer, e-Cheque, and the Electronic Bill Presentation and Payment Service.', '128.To further enhance the payment infrastructure, the HKMA is developing a new Faster Payment System (FPS). When the FPS is completed next year, it will provide a round-the-clock inter-bank real-time payment platform allowing banks and SVF service providers to offer their customers faster, more convenient and comprehensive payment and fund transfer services. Meanwhile, the Government will actively explore new payment channels for settling government bills and fees. In addition to facilitating the use of government services, the new channels will encourage more people to make use of innovative payment products and services.', '129.The combination of biometric authentication and financial services has helped consumers manage their finances. To enhance transaction security, many financial institutions offer consumers with authentication options involving biometric features such as fingerprints and voiceprints. To speed up the launch of their new services, some financial institutions using biometric authentication have leveraged the Fintech Supervisory Sandbox (FSS) launched by the HKMA last September to test their biometric authentication services in a risk-controlled environment and under flexible arrangements. We hope that the industry will make good use of the trial environment provided by the FSS, so as to deliver more products and services based on different kinds of new technology. The development of the FSS has also demonstrated the possibility of striking a balance between consumer protection and promotion of innovation with appropriate supervision.', '130.Looking ahead, distributed ledger technology (DLT), including Blockchain, and cyber security will be two major development clusters in Fintech. We will continue to encourage the sector to develop and apply Fintech which has immense potential, and promote Hong Kong as a hub for the application and setting of standards for these technologies. The Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) has been collaborating with the HKMA and a number of banks to explore the feasibility of applying DLT, and published the White Paper on Distributed Ledger Technology in November last year on the first stage of the research project, covering the feasibility of employing DLT on property valuation information management, trade financing and digital identity management. At the same time, the Fintech Innovation Hub jointly established by the HKMA and ASTRI last September offers its IT environment and support to the banking sector for developing prototypes for the use of DLT in trade financing and other aspects, so as to test how the concept can be applied in different operational scenarios. ASTRI will publish the findings in the second White Paper on DLT in the latter half of this year. Furthermore, financial institutions and start-ups in Hong Kong have implemented and actively explored initiatives to apply Blockchain technology in services such as insurance claims and cross-border remittance, with a view to reducing costs and fraud risks as well as enhancing transparency of transactions.', ""131.Cyber security is becoming increasingly important amidst the wider adoption of Fintech. The Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework, Professional Development Programme and Cyber Intelligence Sharing Platform under the HKMA's Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative were recently implemented in December last year. Apart from enhancing protection for consumers in e-banking services, these projects will strengthen Hong Kong's expertise and capability in cyber security."", '132.I envisage that these projects can dovetail with the R&D efforts of the industry to achieve synergy, leading to refinements of Fintech solutions for the benefit of financial institutions, start-ups as well as the community, and offering consumers and enterprises in Hong Kong and around the world a comprehensive range of quality financial services.']"

The event attracted some 8 300 buyers.', '136.The Animation Support Programme has provided support to 65 start-ups or SMEs. Some of these companies won Asia-Pacific awards in the DigiCon6 Asia hosted by the Japanese television broadcaster TBS while a company was also engaged by the international brand Prada for producing a multimedia animated commercial.', '137.We have also sponsored a programme for supporting advertising and music talents. Sixty-six start-ups have benefited so far and one of them, being the only company engaged by Disney outside the US, worked for the advertising production for the film ""Star Wars"".', '138.Over the past decade, we have provided financing or subsidy to over 40 films. These films together won about 100 prizes in different film festivals, showcasing their spectacular achievements.', ""139.2017 marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. We will sponsor or organise a series of celebration events to showcase the robust development of Hong Kong's creative industries to our community and countries around the world.

We will also organise thematic Hong Kong film shows in ten cities in North America, Europe and Asia to highlight the achievements of Hong Kong's film industry."", '140.In addition, we will sponsor exhibitions to be staged locally and in Europe on the works of Hong Kong comic artists, a locally-held response exhibition of the Venice Biennale International Architecture Exhibition and the organisation of fashion shows. These events will help present the accomplishments of various domains of our creative industries in a multi-faceted manner.']"
18,Arts and Culture,"['Arts and Culture', '141.Hong Kong has long been a melting pot of eastern and western cultures. Our inclusiveness and diversity are evidenced by our arts and culture. I believe that many of us are excited about the commissioning of various cultural facilities in the next few years. Apart from the expansion of the Hong Kong Museum of Art and the construction of the East Kowloon Cultural Centre, various facilities in the West Kowloon Cultural District, including the Xiqu Centre, Art Park, Freespace and M+ Museum, will also be completed in the coming few years.', '142.Recurrent expenditure on arts and culture exceeds $4 billion for 2017-18, an increase of over 30 per cent as compared with 2012-13. This will mainly be incurred for art education and promotion, venue support for art activities and subventions for art groups. The recurrent subvention for the nine major performing art groups alone has increased by about ten per cent over the same period. To nurture small and medium performing art groups as well as budding artists, the Government has implemented the Arts Capacity Development Funding Scheme since 2011 and funded a total of 73 projects in the past five rounds of application. In addition, an Art Development Matching Grants Pilot Scheme was launched last year to provide matching grants to art groups and art organisations of different sizes and at different development stages for the amount of donations they raised, with a view to widening their sources of funding and encouraging community support for art and cultural development. Matching grants approved under the first round of the scheme will be disbursed this year.', '143.We will continue to support the exchange activities and performances of art groups and artists through the regular funding schemes of the Home Affairs Bureau and the Hong Kong Arts Development Council. To complement the celebration activities for the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Government will allocate additional resources in 2017-18 to support more local art groups and artists to perform in major overseas and Mainland cities to showcase our cultural strength.']"

This demonstrates the great importance the Government attaches to investing in education and our long-term commitment to this area.', ""146.The Government will implement the free quality kindergarten education policy from the 2017/18 school year to replace the Pre-primary Education Voucher Scheme launched in the 2007/08 school year. The Government's financial commitment to pre-primary education will increase substantially by about $2.7 billion annually."", '147.VPET broadens the learning opportunities for secondary school leavers and in-service personnel, and nurtures the requisite human capital for various sectors. The Government has allocated $288 million to the Vocational Training Council (VTC) to launch a pilot scheme which integrates structured apprenticeship training programmes with on-the-job training since the 2014/15 academic year. The scheme aims to attract and retain talent for industries with keen demand for labour, and will benefit four cohorts of 4 000 trainees in total. In addition, the Government has allocated $200 million to the VTC to implement the Pilot Subsidy Scheme for Students of Professional Part-time Programmes from the 2016/17 academic year, covering programmes in the disciplines of construction, engineering and technology. The scheme is expected to benefit three cohorts of about 5 600 students in total.', '148.In order to nurture talent to meet our social and economic needs, the Government has decided to regularise the Study Subsidy Scheme for Designated Professions/Sectors from the 2018/19 academic year to subsidise students to undertake designated self-financing undergraduate programmes. The number of subsidised places will increase from about 1 000 per cohort to 3 000. Current students of the designated programmes will also receive the subsidy from the 2018/19 academic year. It is expected that about 13 000 students will benefit from the scheme each academic year, involving an expenditure of about $850 million per year.', '149.Furthermore, the Government has established the $1 billion Qualifications Framework (QF) Fund to promote the development and implementation of QF, with a view to continuously enhancing the overall quality and competitiveness of the local workforce. We are actively pursuing opportunities for co-operation with other countries or places in the development of QF. The Education Bureau is conducting comparability study of QFs with relevant authorities in New Zealand, Scotland and Ireland. Such international co-operation can facilitate mutual recognition of qualifications and enhance the mobility of our workforce.', 'Continuing Education', '150.The Continuing Education Fund (CEF) subsidises adults with learning aspirations to pursue continuing education and training. So far, injections into the CEF have totalled $6.2 billion. I propose to inject an additional $1.5 billion into the CEF in 2017-18. We will also consider various measures to enhance the operation of the CEF. In addition, we will raise the tax deduction ceiling for self-education expenses from $80,000 to $100,000, with a view to promoting life-long learning and maintaining a quality workforce.', 'Youth Development', '151.To nurture young people as future leaders with vision, creativity, leadership and a sense of commitment, we have been actively advocating a culture of multi-faceted excellence and providing additional resources to implement various youth development initiatives in recent years. In 2017-18, I will inject $200 million into the Multi-faceted Excellence Scholarship to support local students who excel in areas other than academic performance, for example sports, arts or community services, to pursue undergraduate studies, in a bid to promote multi-faceted excellence. I will also allocate an additional $100 million to expand the International Youth Exchange Programme so as to encourage young people to increase their global exposure and broaden their international horizons.']"
21,Land Resources,"['Land Resources', '152.Increasing land and housing supply is one of the priorities of the Government. Our work not only involves the technical process of land identification and development, but also the balancing of various needs and expectations of stakeholders. This is not an easy task. On the one hand, the Government has to continue its endeavour to increase land supply on all fronts to meet the housing, economic and social development needs of Hong Kong. On the other hand, it is necessary for us to build up a land reserve to meet future demand in a timely manner.', 'Housing Land', '153.On housing land, as at end 2016, the projected supply from the first-hand private residential property market in the next three to four years will be approximately 94 000 units, a record high since the first release of quarterly supply statistics in September 2004. Based on the preliminary assessment of private residential developments known to have started or to be started on disposed sites, the private sector will, on average, produce about 20 300 private residential units each year in the next five years, representing an increase of about 70 per cent over the yearly average in the past five years. As regards public housing supply, for the five-year period from 2016-17 to 2020-21, estimated public housing production by the Hong Kong Housing Authority and the Hong Kong Housing Society will be about 94 500 units, including about 71 800 public rental housing units and about 22 600 subsidised sale flats.', ""154.The 2017-18 Land Sale Programme comprises a total of 28 residential sites, including 20 new sites, capable of providing about 19 000 residential units. Taking into account railway property development projects, the URA's projects and private redevelopment and development projects, we estimate that the potential land supply for private housing in 2017-18 will have a capacity to produce about 32 000 units. The Secretary for Development will announce tomorrow the Land Sale Programme for the next financial year."", '155.To achieve the ten-year housing supply target, we must address the shortfall in land supply for public housing development. Through the Steering Committee on Land Supply, I will co-ordinate and supervise the work on land supply with a view to narrowing the difference as soon as possible in order that applicants who are waiting for public rental housing can be housed earlier. Once again, I call on the relevant District Councils, local communities and LegCo members to support the rezoning of various sites for housing use in the overall interests of the community, so that people who are yearning for a residential flat can secure one at the earliest possible time.', 'Commercial/Industrial Land', ""156.To maintain Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, we have to ensure a continued supply of office space, especially Grade A office space. At the same time, we need to provide space which is more flexible and affordable for industrial and commercial operation, to facilitate the development of different trades in Hong Kong."", '157.The Government will continue to increase land supply for different economic activities through various measures in order to sustain our competitiveness. From 2012-13 to 2016-17, a total of 23 sites for commercial/industrial use have been sold/will be put up for sale, capable of providing about 1.02 million square metres of floor area, representing an increase of about 1.8 times compared with the previous five years. In the same period, the Government sold three hotel sites, capable of providing some 1 900 hotel rooms.', '158.The Land Sale Programme for the coming financial year includes three commercial/business sites and one hotel site, capable of providing about 172 000 square metres of floor area and some 550 hotel rooms respectively.', '159.The Government will continue to increase the supply of commercial floor area through various means. Apart from approximately 560 000 square metres of commercial/office floor area to be released through reprovisioning the existing government facilities in the two action areas in Kwun Tong and Kowloon Bay, a number of large commercial sites will be made available to the market in the next few years. They include the Queensway Plaza site, the site on top of the terminus of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (Hong Kong Section), Site 3 of the new Central Harbourfront, the Caroline Hill Road site, the Sai Yee Street site and various sites in Kai Tak, capable of providing a total of about 1.1 million square metres of floor area.', 'Long-term Development', '160.While carrying out large-scale new land development and building up a land reserve, we need to formulate a comprehensive development strategy for meeting various challenges, especially those posed by our ageing population, ageing building stock and a shrinking workforce. The Development Bureau and the Planning Department are conducting public engagement for ""Hong Kong 2030+: Towards a Planning Vision and Strategy Transcending 2030"" (""Hong Kong 2030+""), which has put forward a number of policy directives and recommendations. The aim is to formulate long-term planning for Hong Kong\'s sustainable development and create sufficient development and environment capacity for meeting future land resources demand and conserving our natural assets. The public engagement exercise of ""Hong Kong 2030+"" will last until the end of April this year.

The medium-term economic forecast is based on the assumption that there are no severe external shocks during the period, and has taken into account the impact on economic growth posed by an ageing population. That said, as the external environment is laden with uncertainties, we must remain vigilant.', ""178.The Medium Range Forecast projects, mainly from a macro perspective, the Government's expenditure requirements from 2018-19 to 2021-22. It is noteworthy that annual expenditure on infrastructure projects will soon exceed $100 billion, significantly higher than the annual average of about $40 billion as recorded by the previous-term Government. In fact, this projection has not reflected the substantial commitment which the Government will have to make for a number of land development, highways and railway projects once they are ready for rollout. Besides, over the medium term from 2018-19 to 2021-22, growth of recurrent government expenditure is estimated to range between 5.3 per cent and 9.8 per cent per annum, consistently higher than the average annual nominal economic growth of 4.5 per cent over the same period. Sustainability is an issue which deserves our attention."", '179.Regarding revenue, the land revenue estimate for 2017-18 makes reference to the Land Sale Programme and the land supply target of the year. The medium range forecast on land revenue is based on the average proportion of land revenue to GDP over the past ten years, which is 3.3 per cent of GDP. Compared with recent years, when land revenue was referenced to its average proportion to GDP in the past 30 years which is 2.8 per cent of GDP, we have taken a more aggressive assumption. I also assume that the growth rate of revenue from profits tax and other taxes will be similar to the economic growth rate in the next few years.', '180.Based on the above assumptions, I forecast an annual surplus in the Operating Account for the coming five financial years but an annual deficit would surface in the Capital Account as from 2018-19. There will be a small deficit in the Consolidated Account in 2020-21 and 2021-22.

It is indeed a journey that we should take on together, and a goal that needs to be achieved through the concerted efforts of our community.', '186.What are our expectations of the Government nowadays? What is our ideal way of life? How can we attain a sense of well-being? Many Hong Kong people, in particular the younger generation, would answer: Happiness in life is not about earning a living, but about having the freedom to pursue higher ends. They want to have room and opportunities to realise their dreams while doing jobs that suit their interests. They want to have a decent place to live in so that they can start their own family. They want to preserve and conserve the nature and our cultural heritage, as well as enrich their lives by exploring arts and culture.
