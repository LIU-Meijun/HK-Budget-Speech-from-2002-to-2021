1,2013,[Introduction],"['Mr President,', 'I move that the Appropriation Bill 2013 be read a second time.', ""2.Last month, the Chief Executive announced a series of new policies worth $60 billion in the first Policy Address of the current-term Government. I shall provide financial resources to fully support these initiatives. In this Budget, I am going to introduce proposals in four areas, namely developing the economy, optimising human resources, investing in infrastructure and caring for people's livelihood. I shall also share my thinking about future challenges posed by an ageing population. The package of measures in this Budget will have a stimulus effect of 1.3 percentage points. I hope that with these measures, we shall not only promote economic growth and invest in the future, but also improve employment opportunities and people's livelihood in a bid to address the aspirations of different sectors of the community."", ""3.This is my sixth year as Financial Secretary. Looking back, the Hong Kong economy survived a number of major challenges that threatened to bring our external trade and economic growth to a standstill, take unemployment to an all-time high and see investor confidence fall to an all-time low. I am honoured to have contributed to and steered through the economic rebound and consolidation, shoulder to shoulder with the Hong Kong community. But the road ahead remains bumpy. Challenges to Hong Kong's economic growth, commerce and trading, public finance, financial services, land and development matters abound. With resolve and commitment to serve for the coming five years, I shall continue to do my level best to nurture and grow our economy, to keep Hong Kong a land of opportunities, a place that values fair and just opportunities while caring for the less privileged: a place we truly call home.""]"
2,2013,[Economic Performance in 2012],"['4.The external environment was unfavourable in 2012. In general, there were setbacks in external trade over the year, but domestic demand was stable. Due to weak demand from the advanced economies, the overall economy saw sub-trend growth throughout the year. GDP growth for 2012 as a whole was only 1.4 per cent, much lower than the average of 4.5 per cent over the past ten years.', ""5.The weak fundamentals of the European and US economies weighed on the trade flows in Asia. Hong Kong's exports of goods declined in the second quarter of 2011, the export performance remained weak in the first half of 2012 and improved slightly in the second half. For 2012, exports of goods saw moderate growth by only 1.3 per cent in real terms. Exports of services were also dragged down by the unfavourable external environment and grew by only 1.2 per cent in real terms in 2012."", '6.The domestic sector maintained stable growth in 2012. Thanks to high employment and improved income, private consumption grew by four per cent in real terms for the year. Despite rather cautious business sentiments, building and construction activities as well as machinery and equipment acquisition remained buoyant, further driving up overall investment spending by 9.1 per cent last year.', '7.Realising that our economy was facing a huge downward risk, I introduced a package of measures in my Budget last year which stimulated a GDP growth of 1.5 percentage points. These measures were mainly to support small and medium enterprises (SMEs), help our people, preserve employment and lessen the impact of the economic slowdown. The labour market remained stable in 2012. Despite a slight rebound in the unemployment rate from its low of 3.2 per cent in mid-year to the latest 3.4 per cent, the labour market was still in a state of full employment.', '8.There was a real increase in pay in 2012, even though economic growth was slow and the impact of Minimum Wage has faded. Averaged over the previous year, the pay and wage in the first three quarters of 2012 rose by 6.7 per cent and 5.9 per cent respectively, representing increases of 2.5 per cent and 1.9 per cent in real terms after discounting inflation.', ""9.Inflation has dropped continuously since early last year. This is partly attributed to the reduction in imported inflation due to the retreat of international food and commodity prices and easing inflation in our major import sources. Another contributing factor is the slight reduction in local costs as a result of economic slowdown. The headline inflation rate dropped from a peak of 6.4 per cent in the third quarter of 2011 to 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012, averaging 4.1 per cent for 2012 as a whole. Netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate fell from 6.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011 to 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012, averaging 4.7 per cent for 2012 as a whole.""]"
3,2013,[Economic Outlook for 2013],"[""10.2013 will be a challenging year. While the US has made some progress in tackling its fiscal problems, the pace of its economic recovery remains slow. Though the European debt crisis has temporarily stabilised, the economies there have already plunged into recession. Japan is beset by high debts, and it is difficult to tell whether the Japanese government's stimulus measures will help renew economic growth. Taking a macro perspective of the world's economy, continued modest growth is expected amid downside risks. The quantitative easing programmes launched by the advanced economies facing a prolonged economic downturn will lead to fluctuations in the markets, ultra-abundant liquidity with unpredictable fund flows, and potentially give rise to stronger protectionist sentiments. This, combined with various geopolitical factors, will cast a negative outlook for global trade."", '11.The intricate external environment will remain unstable in the year ahead. The whole world will have to face wars on three fronts, namely ""currency"", ""trade"" and ""geopolitics"". As a highly open and small economy, Hong Kong will be impacted by the development of these wars to a certain extent.', ""12.Fundamentals in Asia remain strong and the Mainland economy regained its growth momentum in the fourth quarter of last year. Barring an abrupt deterioration in the demand from the advanced economies, Hong Kong's external trade should see some improvement. On the domestic front, buoyed by the largely stable labour market, local consumption is expected to sustain modest growth. The pick-up in construction works and vibrant inbound tourism will remain the driving force of domestic demand this year. I expect a modest improvement in our economy this year and forecast Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 1.5 to 3.5 per cent for the year. This growth rate is still lower than the average over the past decade and there may be some upward pressure on the unemployment rate."", '13.The inflationary trend will be affected by the internal and external environments as well as overall demand. On the external front, we must not overlook the risk of increasing international commodity and asset prices arising from excessive global liquidity. Moreover, new rounds of quantitative easing in Europe, the US and Japan may trigger another round of imported inflation. Locally, slow economic growth has eased the pressure on wages. However, given the upcoming upward adjustment to the Minimum Wage in the middle of this year coupled with the persistently high rental levels, inflation will face upward pressure. The average headline inflation rate for 2013 is estimated at 4.5 per cent, with the underlying inflation at 4.2 per cent.']"
4,2013,[Developing the Economy and Increasing Employment],"[""14.As the world's economic balance shifts to Asia, Hong Kong should ride the wave of the new order by capitalising on our unique advantages and exploring new business opportunities to take Hong Kong's economy to new heights."", ""15.During the Budget consultation, many people mentioned the role of the Government in the development of a market economy, and the general consensus was that the free and open mode of economic development which had been the key to Hong Kong's success should be maintained. We maintain a simple and low tax regime while prudently controlling government expenditure to leave most of the wealth to the market and the public. Entrepreneurs, investors and members of the public are free to make their own decisions on business, investment and employment issues, making it possible to use the limited resources more effectively."", '16.This does not mean that the Government is merely reactive. In fact, the Government has been playing a pivotal role in the market economy, especially in times of market failure when it takes steps to restore the market balance to ensure that the community can share the fruits of economic growth. The Government acts as provider of public service, mediator in the allocation of public resources as well as negotiator in discussions with other governments. As I see it, government participation and market operation are complementary concepts. What matters is how to make the two work together, and how to strike a balance between social costs and benefits.', ""17.The current-term Government will continue to count on market forces and act in a rational and pragmatic manner in collaborating with the market to grasp development opportunities and create a better business environment to foster robust economic growth underpinned by our established strengths and foundations. The ultimate objective of economic policies is not about chasing after statistics. It is about expanding the scale of Hong Kong's economy, promoting the holistic development of our society and creating more business and job opportunities so that our people can realise their aspirations and improve their living standards. At the same time, the Government will distribute social resources effectively through appropriate policies and measures so that the needy can be provided with appropriate relief and become self-reliant."", '18.To promote future economic development, we must work on two areas. First, we must foster our economic integration with the Mainland to take advantage of its market development. We know the huge Mainland market well. The Government will make good use of all Government-to-Government (G2G) platforms to help Hong Kong enterprises expand their Mainland business, channel overseas capital to the Mainland market, and support Mainland enterprises in ""going global"". More importantly, we must at the same time preserve Hong Kong\'s characteristics as an international city. We must recognise our biggest advantages - a sound legal system, a level-playing field and an excellent business environment. We treasure our core values of individual freedoms, the rule of law and a clean government, which align us with the international system. We shall support our enterprises by strengthening opportunities in traditional markets, exploring new areas of growth and opening up more new markets.', '19.The Economic Development Commission established by the Chief Executive will provide a new platform for the Government to work with the market in the promotion of economic development. It will develop ideas, advise on strategies and policies, examine the structure of different industries, and explore measures for their development.', '20.Second, we must expand and strengthen our pillar industries to maintain our competitiveness. We must also support the development of new industries, build a more diversified and solid economic base, and provide more career choices for our younger generation to realise their potential.', ""21.Traditional pillar industries have been the major driving forces behind Hong Kong's economic development. They have clear advantages internationally and are highly competitive. Currently, the four pillar industries - trading and logistics, tourism, financial services and business and professional services employ 1.7 million people, or 48 per cent of the total labour force. These pillar industries contribute to 59 per cent of our GDP. With a large economic base, they serve as a powerful driver for related sectors and the job market as well. I shall now introduce measures to further promote these industries.""]"
5,2013,[Consolidating Trading and Logistics  Industry],"['22.The trading and logistics industry consolidates different economic and production activities, and creates numerous jobs with different requirements for academic qualifications, skills and experience. The industry currently employs 770 000 workers and contributes to one quarter of GDP, the highest among the four pillar industries.', 'Modern Logistics Services', '23.Due to changes in market demand, the industry is moving towards the provision of high value-added logistics services. Hong Kong is developing into a regional distribution centre for high-value goods, which differs from its conventional role in transporting components, semi-finished products and finished products.', '24.With an efficient intermodal transport network, the status of a free port and a sound legal system to protect intellectual property, Hong Kong has an edge in handling and distributing high-value goods to markets in the region. Our responsive and efficient logistics enterprises can provide high value-added and ""tailor-made"" services to cater for the different needs of customers in respect of supply chain management. Our logistics industry has potential to further expand its regional services, thereby strengthening Hong Kong\'s position as a logistics hub.', '25.We need to build dedicated facilities to help the development of high value-added logistics services which will help shorten operating time and reduce logistics and inventory costs. We have reserved a logistics site with an area of about two hectares at Tsing Yi which will be put on the market in the first half of this year. We also plan to designate about ten hectares of land at Tuen Mun West for the development of logistics facilities. This will facilitate clustering of companies involved in various operations and services for the industry. Tuen Mun West is an ideal site for this. Upon completion of the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link in 2018, it will only take ten minutes to travel from Tuen Mun West to the Airport. We shall conduct a feasibility study on the proposed development and shall release the logistics sites in Tuen Mun West in phases.', '26.Upon completion of the logistics facilities at Tsing Yi and Tuen Mun West, more than 300 000 square metres of floor area and 7 500 new jobs in various trades will be provided, yielding over $3 billion worth of economic benefits annually.', 'Facilitating the Flow of Goods', ""27.After the 911 incident in the US, various countries enhanced their air cargo security requirements. It is imperative that our freight and logistics operators make early moves to gain greater international recognition in cargo safety and management. This will facilitate the customs clearance of our export overseas, and maintain Hong Kong's competitive advantage as a logistics hub."", ""28.The Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) launched the Hong Kong Authorised Economic Operator Programme last April. The Programme accredits local companies with sound internal safety and management systems in accordance with international criteria, giving their consignments customs facilitation, including prioritised clearance and simpler inspection procedures. The C&ED has liaised with other customs authorities to seek mutual recognition of similar programmes, so that locally-accredited companies can enjoy corresponding preferential treatment outside Hong Kong. The C&ED will allocate additional resources to boost companies' participation in the Programme and promote mutual recognition."", 'Transport Infrastructure', '29.To enhance the external connectivity of our transport network, we shall continue to push ahead with the planning and implementation of, sea, land and air transport infrastructure projects.', ""30.Regarding the proposal of constructing Container Terminal 10 at Southwest Tsing Yi, we are conducting a study to examine the technical feasibility and assess the environmental impact of the proposal. The Study on the Strategic Development Plan for Hong Kong Port 2030 is also under way to update port cargo growth forecasts and explore how to make better use of the existing port facilities to support future development. Both studies are scheduled for completion in the first half of this year. In deciding on the need to construct Container Terminal 10, we shall take into account, among other things, the studies' results and the economic situation and the views of stakeholders."", ""31.On land transport, the local projects of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge are scheduled for completion in 2016 to tie in with the opening of the main bridge. This bridge connection will become part of a strategic road network linking Hong Kong, Zhuhai, Macao and Shenzhen. The Western Pearl River Delta (PRD) will fall within a three-hour commute from Hong Kong. The airport and container ports in Hong Kong can be used for transporting goods from the Western PRD, Guangxi Province and nearby countries such as Vietnam and Thailand. This will strengthen Hong Kong's position as a trade, logistics and aviation hub."", '32.On air transport, the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AA) has commenced an environmental impact assessment and other planning for the three-runway system, which is expected to cope with air traffic demand up to at least 2030. The Government will decide on the development of the three-runway system when all relevant information is available.', 'Emerging Markets', ""33.Supporting local enterprises to tap new markets, facilitating trade flows and promoting economic development are important roles of the Government. The Government's work in this area is of particular importance to the development of the modern trading and logistics industry. With our country's strong support, Hong Kong has submitted to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) a request to join the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area to assist our traders to further tap into the emerging Southeast Asian market. ASEAN member states are currently considering our proposed accession, and conducting internal consultations and studies. We shall continue our lobbying work, and collaborate with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) and local trade associations to organise more business missions and discussion forums to enhance interaction between Hong Kong and ASEAN businesses."", ""34.Our efforts to tap emerging markets have started to deliver results. Over the past five years, with more frequent communication through G2G platforms, the trade in goods between Hong Kong and the BRICS countries grew substantially by over 40 per cent in value. Amongst the BRICS countries, our bilateral trade with India registered cumulative growth of over 90 per cent while that with Russia even increased by 1.5 times. To further diversify Hong Kong's export network, we shall continue our efforts to promote Hong Kong in and strengthen trade links with emerging markets.""]"
6,2013,[Promoting Tourism Industry],"['35.Tourism is another mainstay of our economy, employing some 230 000 people and accounting for 4.5 per cent of GDP. In 2012, there were over 48 million visitors to Hong Kong, an increase of 16 per cent over 2011. Despite the gloomy global economic outlook, total spending associated with inbound tourism increased 16.5 per cent to exceed $300 billion.', '36.Buoyant tourism will undoubtedly put pressure on our control points, hotels, tourist attractions and shopping centres. To sustain the healthy development of the tourism industry, we need to devote more efforts to enhancing tourism infrastructure, hotel supply, market promotion, service support, etc.', '37.Last year, I announced that the Government would look into the further development of Ocean Park and Hong Kong Disneyland. Ocean Park is the winner of the prestigious 2012 Applause Award, the first-ever Asian attraction to be recognised as the best theme park in the world. To further enhance its facilities, Ocean Park will build an all-weather Water World at Tai Shue Wan. The Government will offer a $2.3 billion loan to Ocean Park to spur early commencement of the project. We shall submit a funding proposal to the Finance Committee in the next few months. In the coming few years, Hong Kong Disneyland will launch a new night-time parade and put in place a themed area featuring ""Marvel heroes"", the first of its kind in the world. These new projects will be funded by the Disneyland\'s operating surplus. Meanwhile, the two theme parks are actively pursuing new hotel projects to provide better complementary services for tourists.', '38.The terminal building and the first berth of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal will be commissioned in the middle of this year. Preparations are in full swing for the Terminal to receive its first liner, Mariner of the Seas with a capacity of 3 840 passengers, on 12 June. Meanwhile, we are actively working with the Hong Kong Tourism Board to promote cruise tourism, and collaborate with the travel trade and neighbouring ports on itinerary development and regional co-operation. We aim to exploit the potential of cruise tourism in Asia Pacific and attract more high-spending cruise trip visitors to Hong Kong, so as to reinforce our position as a regional cruise hub.', '39.Increasing the supply of hotels will help enhance receiving capacity and service quality. Currently, there are over 210 hotels in Hong Kong, providing more than 67 000 rooms. The Government has been working to make available more hotel rooms through various measures, including providing ""hotel only"" sites. As at end-2012, 13 applications for redevelopment or wholesale conversion of industrial buildings into hotels were approved by the Lands Department. It is estimated that some 10 000 new hotel rooms will be provided this year and next year.', '40.Following my proposal to extend the operation of the Mega Events Fund last year, we sponsored several major international events, including the Hong Kong Dragon Boat Carnival and the Hong Kong Open Championship (golf tournament). We shall continue to sponsor more international mega events to be held in Hong Kong through the Fund, and use the existing mechanism to subsidise mega events hosted by local non-profit-making organisations. In recent years, our neighbouring cities have organised mega events, such as the Formula 1 Races and overseas NBA games. We shall take the initiative to seek to host more mega events.', '41.In the coming few years, large-scale tourist facilities will come on stream, and there will be major events funded by the Mega Events Fund or hosted in other forms. I believe that the tourism industry will continue to flourish and spur growth in other service sectors, including food and beverage, retail and transport, creating many employment opportunities.']"
7,2013,[Developing Financial Services Industry],"['42.Hong Kong is an international financial centre, and the financial services industry underpins our economy. The industry employs 230 000 people, or six per cent of the total workforce. It is a high value-added industry that contributes 16 per cent to GDP. It is also a major client of professional services and drives growth in other consumer industries. Maintaining the competitive edge of our financial services industry is crucial to economic development. The focus of developing the industry is the diversification of its business and products.', 'Fund and Asset Management Business', '43.The total value of fund assets under management in Hong Kong is more than $9 trillion, ranking second in Asia. As the global economic balance shifts more towards the East, Asia is experiencing some of the fastest wealth growth in the world. We shall seize this opportunity to further develop our fund and asset management business.', '44.To strengthen its position as a premier international asset management centre, Hong Kong will provide relevant legal and regulatory frameworks, and a clear and competitive tax environment with a view to attracting more funds of various types to base in Hong Kong to broaden the variety and scope of our fund business. Hong Kong-domiciled funds will drive demand for professional services such as fund management and investment advice as well as legal and accounting services.', '45.To attract more private equity funds to domicile in Hong Kong, we propose to extend the profits tax exemption for offshore funds to include transactions in private companies which are incorporated or registered outside Hong Kong and do not hold any Hong Kong properties nor carry out any business in Hong Kong. This will allow private equity funds to enjoy the same tax exemption as offshore funds. We shall conduct consultation on the amendments to relevant tax legislation and detailed proposals. ', '46.At present, investment funds established in Hong Kong can only take the form of trusts. As an international financial centre, Hong Kong should provide a more flexible business environment for the industry to meet market demand. To attract more traditional mutual funds and hedge funds to domicile in Hong Kong, we are considering legislative amendments to introduce the Open-ended Investment Company, an increasingly popular form used in the fund industry. We are discussing the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks with regulators. The public will be consulted once a proposal is drawn up.', ""47.To expand the distribution network of Hong Kong's fund industry, the Securities and Futures Commission is studying with the Mainland authorities an arrangement for mutual recognition of funds. The arrangement will attract more funds to establish in Hong Kong and foster the development of those professional sectors engaged in the registration, investment management and sales of funds."", ""48.In addition, the Government has introduced two bills into this Council, with a view to enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness in the development of Islamic finance and facilitating the development of trusts services industry in Hong Kong."", '49.As the Mainland experiences rapid growth in wealth and a steady opening of its capital account, the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) Scheme, which allows investment of Mainland capital in offshore financial markets, is expected to be further relaxed. This will help the growth of the private wealth management business in Hong Kong. The number of private banks in Hong Kong has increased from 27 at end-2007 to 41 now. To tie in with the development of private wealth management, the Government and the regulators will continue to support the work of the sector in setting up a trade association, taking forward programmes relating to the accreditation and enhancing the training of practitioners.', 'Insurance Business', '50.The Government is seeking to introduce a bill into this Council within this year to establish an independent Insurance Authority to align the insurance regulatory regime in the local insurance industry with international practices. This will facilitate the development of the industry and protect the interests of policyholders.', ""51.Many large enterprises in Asia are keen to run their own captive insurance companies to insure against their business risks. To attract more enterprises to form captive insurance companies in Hong Kong, I propose to reduce the profits tax on the offshore insurance business of captive insurance companies, such that they will enjoy the same tax concessions as those currently applicable to reinsurance companies. Attracting a cluster of large-scale captive insurers in Hong Kong will promote the development of other related businesses, including reinsurance, making Hong Kong's risk management services more diversified."", 'Offshore Renminbi Business Centre', ""52.Hong Kong is now the world's largest and most efficient offshore RMB business hub, with the world's largest offshore pool of RMB. Total RMB deposits and outstanding RMB certificates of deposits stood at RMB 720 billion at end-2012."", ""53.Hong Kong also serves as a platform for enterprises and financial institutions all over the world to carry out various financial activities such as RMB payments, financing and investments. RMB trade settlement conducted through Hong Kong banks in 2012 exceeded RMB 2,600 billion, a year-on-year increase of 37 per cent and representing over 90 per cent of the Mainland's cross-border trade settled in RMB. The RMB bond market also showed continuous growth. At end-2012, outstanding RMB bonds issued in Hong Kong exceeded RMB 230 billion, an increase of 62 per cent over end-2011."", ""54.Since the launch of the RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (RQFII) Scheme at end-2011, the range of offshore RMB investment products has been broadened. Among them, Exchange Traded Funds tracking the A-share indices have been well received by the market. We shall continue our dialogue with the relevant Mainland authorities to expedite the next stage of RQFII's expansion, which will include extending the pilot scheme to qualified Hong Kong financial institutions. These measures will promote the circulation of RMB funds and diversify the development of RMB investment products. We shall continue to strengthen our market infrastructure, and stay connected with other financial centres in the world with a view to further enhancing the use of RMB for trade settlement, financing and investment at the international level, consolidating Hong Kong's position as an offshore RMB business centre."", 'Basel III', '55.The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision announced in early January the details of the revised regulatory liquidity standards of Basel III to be implemented progressively between 2015 and 2019. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is assessing the impact of the revision on the local banking sector to draw up a corresponding implementation plan for industry consultation. We shall devise regulatory rules that suit our financial markets and business environment to promote the stability of our banking system.', 'Government Bond Programme', '56.Since the launch of the Government Bond Programme in 2009, the systematic offering of bonds has attracted local and overseas investors to the Hong Kong bond market and expanded the investment base. As at early February this year, outstanding bonds issued under the Programme totalled about $70 billion.', '57.Given the situation of global financial markets, there has been a sustained growth in the demand from investors and financial institutions in Asia and other emerging markets for high quality public debt papers, including Hong Kong Dollar government debt. I hope that the Government Bond Programme can be expanded to meet the criteria of certain global benchmark bond indices to attract more investors. To further promote the sustainable development of our bond market, I propose to expand the size of the Government Bond Programme from the current $100 billion to $200 billion to provide adequate room for the Programme to continue in the next five years. We shall move in due course an amendment resolution in this Council to raise the maximum amount of borrowings under the Government Bond Programme.', ""58.The Government also issued two sets of inflation-linked retail bonds (iBond) under the Government Bond Programme. Both the total amount of applications and the total application amounts for the iBond issued last year set a new record for local retail bonds, reflecting the investing public's greater awareness of, and interest in, retail bonds. To maintain this growth momentum, I propose launching a further iBond issue of up to $10 billion under the Government Bond Programme. The iBond, with a maturity of three years, will target Hong Kong residents. Interest will be paid to bond holders once every six months at a rate linked to the inflation rates of the last half-year period. The HKMA will announce the details in due course. I have to point out that the further issuance of iBond is a measure to address the current low-interest rate environment. It is a non-recurrent measure. In the long run, the Government will not confine bond issuance to a particular type of bonds. We shall develop different types of bonds for a more diversified bond market in Hong Kong."", 'Stored Value Facilities and Retail Payment Systems', '59.Over the past ten years, the number of local internet banking accounts has increased at an average annual rate of 22 per cent to over eight million at present, with an average transaction volume of around $4 trillion per month. Shopping and bill paying on innovative online and electronic payment platforms are becoming increasingly popular. The development of electronic payment instruments and retail payment systems can make payment processing more efficient for companies, especially those in the retail industry. Such development will encourage local enterprises to extend their global sales networks, and stimulate the growth of other ancillary trades, including electronic transaction services and computer system developments. We are considering possible amendments to the legislation to introduce a licensing regime for stored value electronic money and to empower the HKMA to supervise the relevant retail payment systems, which will help establish a sound regulatory regime for Hong Kong.', '60.Given the rapid developments in the global financial markets, the Government needs to tap advice from market experts. The Chief Executive has announced the establishment of the Financial Services Development Council, a high-level, cross-sector advisory body, to offer views and suggestions to the Government on developing and promoting our financial services industry as well as reinforcing our position as an international financial centre.']"
8,2013,[Expanding Business and Professional  Services],"['61.With some  470 000 employees and accounting for 12 per cent of GDP, business support and professional services are another pillar industry of the Hong Kong economy. They comprise a wide range of professional and supporting services for business activities, such as legal, accounting, architecture, engineering, planning, surveying, human resources, management consultancy, technical testing, product development and distribution, market research, conference and exhibition, and information technology.', ""62.Apart from serving local enterprises, Hong Kong's business and professional services are also exported to the Mainland and other areas in Asia. We shall continue to assist these service industries through relevant G2G platforms. Under the National 12th Five-Year Plan, the Mainland will devote greater efforts to developing modern service industries to lift the share of the service industries in the economy by four percentage points by 2015. Such scale of expansion far exceeds Hong Kong's GDP in one year. This will present vast business opportunities to the sectors concerned in Hong Kong. For continuous enhancement of the CEPA mechanism, the Chief Executive has announced that the HKSAR Government and the Ministry of Commerce will set up a joint working group to assist the sectors concerned to solve problems they encounter in gaining access to the Mainland market under CEPA.""]"
9,2013,[Nurturing Emerging Industries],"[""63.Apart from building on our traditional strengths, we also give strong support for the development of emerging industries to further diversify our economy, so that Hong Kong can better respond to the world's ever-changing economic environment. Over the past couple of years, the Government has promoted six industries where Hong Kong enjoys clear advantages. These industries employ 420 000 people, or 12 per cent of the total workforce, and contribute to 8.5 per cent of GDP. The Government will keep an eye on the development of new industries and proactively provide appropriate support for emerging industries with the potential to flourish."", '64.On nurturing emerging industries, the efforts of the Government and the industries concerned have borne fruit. Among the emerging industries, the cultural and creative industries, employing 190 000 persons, have been taking up an increasing share of GDP, which now approaches five per cent. To the credit of these practitioners, they have won numerous international awards and accolades. Apart from the film industry, other industries in the sector also made impressive achievements. Despite the global economic slowdown over the past few years, our design and architecture sectors have, during the five years leading up to 2011, achieved an average annual growth rate of 20 per cent in terms of value added and five per cent in terms of the number of practitioners. Another notable achievement is that local advertising companies scooped a total of 60 awards in three different international advertising competitions. In 2011, local enterprises spent more than $35 billion on advertising, an increase of 16 per cent over the previous year. The local advertising industry continues to boom, employing 18 000 people and bringing $6.8 billion worth of economic benefits. With the huge domestic demand in the Mainland as a result of sustained economic growth, our cultural and creative industries have great development potential. We shall continue to provide strong support for the industries with a view to opening up more business opportunities and markets.', '65.In recent years, Hong Kong has played host to a number of art fairs which have attracted many well-established art galleries from different corners of the world. We shall host a number of world-class art fairs again this year, including Art Basel - Hong Kong, inaugural show in Asia. These major events will help pool overseas and local art-related participants and foster interaction and exchanges among them. Successful art fairs will also facilitate art and cultural development in Hong Kong, and highlight our potential as an international art metropolis.', ""66.To foster the development of visual arts and nurture local talent in the field, we are converting the club house of the former Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club in Oil Street, North Point into a visual arts exhibition and activity centre. I also propose additional funding of $50 million for the Leisure and Cultural Services Department to acquire local visual artists' outstanding artworks, and to commission works for exhibition under public art schemes. These are set to promote the profile of local artists and bring their works to the attention of the art market."", '67.Today, many internationally renowned scholars work in local universities to conduct research. Their efforts contribute to the development of Hong Kong\'s research and development (R&D) capabilities. Top researchers working in our universities and enterprises have won numerous awards. Last year, 56 Hong Kong scientists were approved by the State Ministry of Science and Technology for inclusion in the National Science and Technology Programmes Expert Database. They are now qualified to participate in the compilation of the application guide and in project assessment for national science and technology programmes. Internationally, the ""Interactive Intention-Driven Upper-Limb Training Robotic System"", a project under the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF), was awarded the ""Grand Prix Du Salon International Des Inventions De Gen猫ve"" in the 40th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva in 2012, making it the first invention from Hong Kong to receive the grand prize.', ""68.In my view, if we can transform technology research outcomes into products with market potential, coupled with industrial production, our technological development can make an even greater contribution to Hong Kong's economy. To facilitate technology transfers and the realisation of R&D results, six local universities have set up their own technology transfer offices to deal with the complicated process of commercialising R&D results. I propose that these six universities be each provided with a subvention of up to $12 million through the ITF for a period of three years from 2013-14 onwards to support the work of their technology transfer offices."", '69.Technology and product R&D will stimulate the development of intellectual property trading.

It is the biggest expenditure area amongst different policy area groups.', '74.A quality teaching force is the key to the quality of education. I propose to inject an additional $480 million into the HKSAR Government Scholarship Fund (GSF) to set up scholarships for outstanding local students to take degree courses or teacher training programmes in prestigious overseas universities.

The Government launched the Qualifications Framework (QF) in 2008, embracing qualifications in the academic, vocational and continuing education sectors and establishing flexible learning pathways with multiple entry and exit points. Industry Training Advisory Committees (ITACs) are set up under the QF to develop the Specifications of Competency Standards (SCSs), and to promote and implement the QF within the industry. The QF also provides a platform to facilitate the development of diverse pathways for career progression, and practitioners can receive recognition at various levels based on their prior practice and experience.', '78.To further enhance the knowledge and skills of workers in the industries, and their competitiveness in the labour market, I propose to allocate $10 million per year to support ITACs to launch new initiatives.

14,2013,[Enhancing Vocational Training],"[""79.The sustained development of all sectors hinges on quality workers. Some sectors, including the construction, retail and catering industries, have experienced labour shortage in recent years. Members of these sectors have urged the Government to follow other countries' example and allow large-scale labour importation. In my opinion, the shortage problem facing some sectors is caused by the surge in labour demand arising from their rapid development, coupled with the fact that a labour mismatch does exist in the labour market."", ""80.Hong Kong's economic growth has been driven by economic upgrading and restructuring for many decades. We have a flexible labour market where the quality of labour keeps improving to meet the needs of a changing economic structure. We should first consider how to provide more suitable training programmes and complementary measures to channel more workers to these sectors. This is to make good use of local labour to enhance the productivity of the whole community. No doubt, local workers should be given priority for quality employment opportunities in all sectors. However, I understand that there may be transitional labour shortages for some jobs in certain sectors, or even longer-term shortages in a number of obnoxious trades. The Government will follow its existing policy and mechanisms in dealing with labour importation."", '81.A long-term labour shortage will hinder the development of industries, affect the employment market and even dampen our economic vibrancy. We must find the right match between the industries and the workforce. Trade associations and stakeholders of some industries have been forthcoming with proposals to improve training and labour supply for their respective industries. A feasible option for attracting new blood into the industries is to develop structured training programmes that link up enrolment of trainees, vocational training, job attachment and job matching. Such training programmes should be coupled with appropriate subsidies as incentives, and effective publicity. These will allow more young people and their families to have a better understanding of the industries concerned.', '82.Take the construction industry as an example. The efforts on training made by the industry in recent years have begun to produce results. The industry\'s co-ordinating body, the Construction Industry Council (CIC) has all along been striving to enhance training for the construction workforce. I allocated a total of $320 million in 2010 and 2012 to support the CIC\'s labour training, which includes granting subsidies to contractors to employ trainees on a ""first-hire-then-train"" basis to enable them to gain actual work experience on construction sites. Training allowances are provided for those trades facing labour shortages to attract new entrants. More than 2 000 training places have been provided by the CIC so far, and about 60 per cent of the trainees are aged below 35. We shall also step up our promotion efforts to attract ethnic minorities to join the industry.', '  83.Thanks to the systematic labour training provided by the CIC and the rollout of major infrastructure projects in the past decade, the employment situation of the construction industry has improved notably. The unemployment rate dropped substantially from the post-financial tsunami 12.8 per cent to the latest 5.1 per cent, and the average median monthly income has increased steadily to $13,000. Some of the trades have even seen an appreciable increase in the income of their workers. I encourage other industries in keen demand for labour to follow the example of the construction industry in launching systematic training plans and initiatives to bring in more new recruits.', ""84.As elaborated by the Chief Executive in his Policy Address, further enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international shipping centre is one of the Government's priorities. The shipping industry offers plenty of quality job opportunities with promising prospects. The shipping companies registered in Hong Kong own and manage a total of about 2 000 merchant ships, which make up ten per cent of the world's merchant fleet. There are about 700 shipping-related companies in Hong Kong, offering a wide range of services such as shipping management, agency, finance, legal services and arbitration, and a large number of jobs. At present, the Hong Kong International Airport offers more than 60 000 jobs."", '85.To support training for the local shipping and aviation industry, I propose to designate $100 million to establish a training fund for maritime and aviation transport, so as to sustain and expand various schemes and scholarships, and to implement other new initiatives. This will help attract young people to enrol in related skills training and degree programmes and join the industry upon graduation, providing a wealth of vibrant and competitive talent for the industry.', '86.The retail industry accounts for about four per cent of GDP and employs over 300 000 people. While the robust development of tourism should mean more business opportunities, the retail industry suffers from an increasing shortage of labour, with the current vacancy rate standing at over three per cent. Difficulties in retaining and recruiting quality people have an imminent impact on the service quality of the industry, and may adversely affect economic development. To facilitate its healthy growth in the long term, I shall set up a task force on labour development in the retail industry. Led by the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the task force will pool the efforts of the Government, the industry and relevant organisations. It will study the economic outlook of the industry and its labour demand and supply. The task force will complete its work within this year and put forward appropriate and concrete recommendations.']"

In 2013-14, the ERB will offer 130 000 training places. Resources have also been reserved to provide an additional 40 000 places to meet the demand from training providers for increasing or redeploying places.', '88.Levy on employers of foreign domestic helpers is the major financial source of the ERB. In his Policy Address, the Chief Executive announced the abolition of the levy.

The expansion of Tseung Kwan O Hospital and the phase two redevelopment of Caritas Medical Centre will also be completed in 2013 and 2014 respectively. We are preparing for the redevelopment of Queen Mary Hospital, Kwong Wah Hospital and United Christian Hospital. The estimated costs will be as high as $25 billion. In addition, we plan to use $20 billion for the construction and refurbishment of several public hospitals and clinics, including the construction of Tin Shui Wai Hospital and the Centre of Excellence in Paediatrics, the refurbishment of Hong Kong Buddhist Hospital as well as the reprovisioning of the Yau Ma Tei Specialist Clinic.', '93.The Government will continue to provide various sports facilities for the public. The new indoor heated pool complex at Victoria Park is expected to come into operation in the third quarter of this year. We shall seek funding approval for the construction of an indoor stadium with a heated pool in Tsing Yi. Upon completion of the project, there will be 25 heated pools for public use in Hong Kong.', '94.Construction works of the velodrome in Tseung Kwan O will be completed in the second half of this year. We are also taking forward in phases the development of a cycle track network connecting the East and West New Territories. The construction of the Ma On Shan-Sheung Shui section is expected to complete by end-2013. We plan to seek funding approval this year to construct part of the Sheung Shui-Yuen Long section.', '95.We shall continue to invest in environmental infrastructure to improve our environment. On water quality, we have completed the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme Stage 1, and there has been significant improvement in the overall water quality of Victoria Harbour. Stage 2A of the Scheme, a $17.6 billion project, is scheduled for completion in 2014. To further reduce waste at source, we are pressing ahead with the first phase development of the organic waste treatment facilities in Siu Ho Wan, Lantau. Scheduled for commissioning in 2016, the facilities will convert food waste into energy and compost products. We have also earmarked $500 million to set up waste electrical and electronic equipment processing facilities as well as five community green stations to encourage public participation in waste reduction and recycling.', '96.Fresh water resources in the Mainland are limited, and the demand for Dongjiang water in Guangdong Province is on the rise. In face of scarce resources, we must encourage our people through public education to save water, and explore new water sources so as to ensure sustainable supply for Hong Kong amid climate change and population growth.', ""97.Last year, we started a detailed planning and investigation study, including an assessment of the feasibility and cost-effectiveness, for the construction of a desalination plant on a reserved site in Tseung Kwan O, with a view to tapping sea water as a water source. Although the anticipated output capacity of the desalination plant will only account for five to ten per cent of Hong Kong's total water consumption, we hope that as technology advances and costs go down in the future, seawater desalination can serve as another water supply source and help reduce our reliance on other water sources in the long term."", '98.With the major infrastructure projects entering their construction peaks, it is estimated that capital works expenditure will increase to over $70 billion for each of the next few years, far exceeding the average annual expenditure of about $40 billion in the past five years. These large infrastructure projects create a large number of jobs which are particularly crucial in times of uncertain economic outlook.']"

We shall continue the practice of announcing government-initiated land sale arrangements in advance on a quarterly basis, and exercise flexibility in supplying housing land in the light of market demand. In the coming year, all the major sources of land supply for private housing together, which include the Government's Land Sale Programme, railway property development projects, projects of the Urban Renewal Authority, and lease modifications/land exchanges or other private developments, will provide land capable of building some 25 800 private residential flats. The Secretary for Development will announce the Land Sale Programme for the coming year tomorrow."", '101.On public housing, we have provided the Housing Authority with adequate land to build 79 000 public rental housing flats within five years from 2012-13, and about 17 000 Home Ownership Scheme flats within four years from 2016-17.', 'Supply of Private Residential Flats in Short Term', '102.I announced two demand-side management measures last Friday in a bid to cool down the overheated property market. I will not repeat the details of the measures today. Increasing supply is the key to solving the housing problem. In the next three to four years, it is estimated that a total of 67 000 first-hand units would come onto the private residential property market, the highest since September 2007. These include 4 000 unsold units in completed projects, 48 000 unsold units under construction, and 15 000 units to be constructed on disposed sites.', '103.As for the supply of private residential flats in 2013, I estimate that 24 000 first-hand units can be offered for sale this year, including 12 000 uncompleted units, for which we are speeding up the processing of their pre-sale consent applications, 8 000 uncompleted units ready for pre-sale and 4 000 unsold units in completed projects.', '104.Developers usually adjust the pace of sales according to market appetite, and may not put all the 24 000 flats on the market this year. However, we are sure that the supply of first-hand units has seen a rebound. As the external economic environment remains volatile, I would like to remind people once again that interest rates are susceptible to various external factors and will resume an upturn cycle in the future. Before making a home purchase decision, people should assess their ability to afford the property, particularly whether family income can support mortgage payments if mortgage rates are to revert to a normal level.']"
19,2013,[Increasing Commercial Land],"['105.Apart from housing land, the Government is also committed to increasing the supply of commercial land to provide room for further development of different economic activities in Hong Kong.

26,2013,[Easing Pressure and Stimulating Economic  Growth],"['126.During the Budget consultation, political parties and members of the public made many suggestions on relief and concessionary measures. They have diverse views on whether we should continue the one-off relief measures implemented in recent years. I understand that members of the public, especially the grass roots, hope that the Government will help ease the heavy burden and pressure on them. Some, however, opined that one-off hand-outs are undesirable as resources should be expended to implement appropriate policies to provide recurrent support to the needy. I must stress that the allocation of resources by the Government is based on the principle of ""policy leads and financial resources follow"". For one-off measures or otherwise, the use of all government expenditure should be strictly subject to the same principle of fiscal prudence. We must commit our resources only when justified and needed. Every dollar should be spent on appropriate measures, and not squandered.', ""127.One-off measures, from a micro perspective, can help ease the community's burden, and are counter-cyclical from a macro perspective for coping with short-term economic fluctuations, maintaining spending power and supporting the employment market. The measures I proposed in last year's Budget had a stimulus effect on GDP that helped maintain local economic growth and a low unemployment rate. In the year ahead, having regard to the uncertain external outlook and the risk of rising inflation caused by quantitative easing measures in various countries, I consider that we still have to introduce some stimulus measures."", ""128.I have also been listening to the voices of people from the middle class. They have expressed to me the heavy burden they have to bear in coping with expenses on rent, medical care, support for their parents, children's education, etc. They hope that I would consider specific tax measures for them. I agree that middle-class families should be given some support. However, as one may appreciate, it is impracticable for the Government to respond to each and every demand. The Government must take into account its overall financial commitments and the fairness of resource allocation. I am inclined to adopt a simple and direct approach through one-off tax reduction and increase in tax allowance as a response to the various aspirations of the middle class."", '129.Many business chambers and SMEs have also told me that increase in rentals and other costs have posed difficulties to the operation of enterprises. They proposed that the Government should introduce relief measures, including lowering the profits tax rate for SMEs with profits below a particular level. I have given due consideration to their proposals. Profits tax revenue is now sourced from a handful of enterprises while nearly 90 per cent of companies do not have to pay tax. There will be practical difficulty in applying different tax rates to those tax-paying enterprises, and this will complicate our simple tax regime. The low profit-making enterprises will not benefit much as a result. Having regard to the implications of the tax proposals on individual enterprises, our tax base and tax revenue, I am inclined to adopt a simple and direct approach through one-off tax reduction to meet the aspirations of our business sector.', '130.I propose the following one-off measures:', ""131.To alleviate people's burden in raising their children and to encourage self-education and lifelong learning, I propose:"", '132.In the face of the unstable external economic environment and increasing operating costs, apart from the six support measures for SMEs that were mentioned earlier, I propose the following two one-off measures to help our enterprises:', 'The above 11 relief measures, involving $33billion, should be able to help ease the pressure on our middle class, grass roots and SMEs.', 'Note 2', 'Comprehensive Social SecurityAssistance recipients who do not have to bear ratesand public housing rents will not obtain any pecuniary advantage from the twomeasures of waiving rates and paying rents for public housing tenants.', 'Note 3', 'See Note 2.', 'waiving rates for 2013-14 Note2, subject to a ceiling of $1,500 per quarter for each rateable property.

27,2013,[Embracing the Challenges Ahead],"['133.The average life expectancy of Hong Kong people is continuously increasing. We must not overlook the challenges posed by an ageing population.', '134.Last year, the number of elderly people aged 65 and over was 980 000, representing 14 per cent of our population. This proportion continues to rise. According to the latest projection, the number of elderly people will increase significantly to 2.56 million by 2041, representing 30 per cent of our population. As for the elderly dependency ratio in Hong Kong, ten persons of working age (i.e. people aged 15 to 64) supported one dependent elderly person financially in the early 1980s, but the ratio has dropped to five persons supporting one dependent elderly person now. After 20 years, the ratio will further drop to just two persons supporting one dependent elderly person.', '135.The increase in the proportion of elderly population will result in a surge of expenditure on healthcare and welfare. Moreover, a fall in the proportion of working population will reduce economic vibrancy and slow down the momentum of economic growth. These developments will have profound implications for the sustainability of government revenue and public expenditure. Judging from the current demographic trends, our economic growth will certainly continue to taper off in the 2020s and the growth rate will be much lower than the trend growth rate of 4.5 per cent over the past ten years.', '136.Our resource inputs in healthcare and social welfare represent 40 per cent of recurrent government expenditure at present. Take the spending on elderly care for 2012-13 as an example. The estimated expenditure in this area, including the provision of social security, elderly services and healthcare services, has reached $43.4 billion, accounting for 16 per cent of recurrent government expenditure. This spending will inevitably increase significantly with an ageing population because there will be a substantial rise in the demand for patient beds, residential care homes and community elderly care.', '137.With an increase in the number of the elderly, a shrinking working population, reduction in the number of taxpayers and decelerated economic growth, I expect that the growth of government revenue will drop substantially if our tax regime remains unchanged. Meanwhile, expenditure on welfare and healthcare will soar. We may not be able to make ends meet. Some may think that the purpose of building up ample fiscal reserves is to provide a sufficient reserve capital for Hong Kong when our recurrent revenue is not sufficient to cover expenditure. I would say that this is not wrong but is a rather one-sided view. Of course, we can draw on our reserves to tackle short-term financial fluctuations. Yet fiscal reserves is not a regular revenue, it is all that we have at our disposal. The reserves can be exhausted. Prolonged depletion of the reserves to meet ever-increasing recurrent expenditure is not sustainable. Recurrent expenditure must be funded by sustainable revenue.', '138.Apart from meeting our expenditure on public services, fiscal reserves also serve as a buffer in times of economic downturn. Take the five-year deficit between 1998 and 2004 as an example. Our fiscal reserves dropped from an amount equivalent to 28 months of government expenditure originally to a level of 13 months of expenditure in 2004.', ""139.Besides, we have not deducted the Government's known liabilities, commitments and various contingent liabilities from the fiscal reserve figure that is familiar to you. These include capital projects costing over $300 billion, guarantees of $100 billion and statutory pension with a present value of about $600 billion. Although we do not need to settle them in a lump sum within a short period of time, we must not overlook our liabilities and commitments behind the reserves when assessing the HKSAR's overall financial position."", ""140.Looking globally, many economies are also facing the problem of soaring public expenditure in the long run. Some countries use the resources available to plan for the future through saving up part of their fiscal surplus or other receipts and assets. I shall set up a working group to be led by the Treasury Branch. Scholars and experts will be invited to join the working group to explore ways to make more comprehensive planning for our public finances to cope with the ageing population and the Government's other long-term commitments. The working group will report to me by the end of this year.""]"
28,2013,[Adhering to Fiscal Discipline],"['141.Government expenditure has more than doubled from nearly $200 billion in 1997-98 to over $400 billion in 2013-14, while recurrent expenditure has almost doubled from $150 billion to over $290 billion. However, GDP has grown by only 60 per cent for the same period. The use of public resources has always been guided by the principle of pragmatism. Resources are allocated in accordance with actual needs and priorities, taking into account fiscal sustainability. When implementing new policies and measures, especially those involving long-term financial commitments, the Government must consider them thoroughly and conduct appropriate consultation in advance.', ""142.Fiscal sustainability and prudent management of public finances require us to strictly contain the growth of government expenditure. We must not increase expenditure without good cause, or without regard to our low tax regime. Our revenue, now amounting to about 20 per cent of GDP, is unlikely to achieve significant growth. Our public expenditure, on the other hand, has stayed at around the same level in recent years. As we are obliged to uphold the principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenue, the Government would need to increase revenue if we want to increase expenditure. This would mean raising taxes or resorting to borrowing. Both options are controversial. Tax hikes will overhaul our simple and low tax regime which has been the key to our success, and undermine Hong Kong's overall competitiveness in the longer run. This will also adversely affect our community and businesses. We must carefully assess the pros and cons in considering any proposal to increase tax. "", '143.In the wake of the financial tsunami, many European countries and the US have fallen into financial difficulty. The major causes are the prolonged mismanagement of public finances by their governments and over-expanded welfare measures. Beset with huge debts from overspending, these countries eventually find themselves in a dire financial crisis, and have to cut the deficit through fiscal austerity. Hong Kong must draw a lesson from them. We must maintain effective fiscal management and fiscal discipline by adhering to the principles of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues and allocating resources where they are required. Any indiscriminate increase in expenditure will only impose a heavy burden on our next generation.', 'Government Revenue', '144.We need to ensure that the Government has a stable income by preserving tax revenue and adhering to the ""user pays"" principle. Tax revenue, accounting for more than 60 per cent of the total government revenue, exceeds $280 billion in 2013-14. Of this, two-thirds will come from direct taxes (i.e. profits tax, tax under personal assessment, property tax and salaries tax) and the remaining one-third from indirect taxes (e.g. rates, motor vehicles first registration tax and duty on dutiable commodities).', '145.On the premise of maintaining the existing low and simple tax regime, we shall strive to prevent revenue losses on payable taxes. To this end, the Government will examine the tax information stated by taxpayers through an audit and investigation mechanism. Back tax is assessed and penalties are imposed on cases of understatement or omission. In 2011-12, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) collected back tax and penalties of about $6.8 billion, which was 76 per cent higher than that of the previous year. The IRD will continue to combat tax evasion and avoidance, and strive for greater effectiveness by making better use of information technology, reinforcing staff training and adjusting investigation strategies.', '146.Regarding indirect taxes, the annual revenue from tobacco duty and motor vehicles first registration tax is over $4 billion and $7 billion respectively. We notice that the main modus operandi of selling illicit cigarettes has recently changed from street peddling to telephone order, making law enforcement more difficult. On the other hand, some dealers provide false information on the selling prices of vehicles to evade motor vehicles first registration tax, which reduces our tax revenue. To protect the revenue from tobacco duty and motor vehicles first registration tax, the C&ED will deploy more resources to step up its efforts to combat tax evasion in the coming year.', '147.The provision of government services is generally charged in accordance with the ""user pays"" principle. There are thousands of fees and charges, including all types of licence fees and other fees related to the issue of identity documents, registration, etc. The cost recovery rate for some items is as low as 30 per cent. The rate for more than 1 000 fees and charges has not been adjusted since reunification.', '148.In 1997-98, government services with charges determined on a cost-recovery basis generated nearly $12 billion in revenue, equivalent to four per cent of government revenue. In 2011-12, revenue from this source dropped to only $10 billion, or a share of only two per cent of revenue.', ""149.To prevent cost recovery items being turned into heavily subsidised items, we need a systematic review. I shall ask all policy bureaux and departments to review their respective fees and charges, and submit plans for their revision for the coming one or two years. We shall first deal with fees that have not been revised for years and do not directly affect people's livelihood. Examples are fees for pesticide permits, riding establishment licences and temporary permits for exhibitions of animals and birds. We shall also deal with items which have low cost recovery rates such as fees for visas or licences for storage of dangerous goods. The Government will make appropriate fee revisions as and when necessary. There will not be substantial revisions at one go to avoid affecting people's livelihood. We shall also strictly control costs and reduce the need for increasing fees and charges as far as possible. I hope that the community will consider our proposals for fee revisions in a fair and objective manner.""]"
29,2013,[Revised Estimates for 2012-13],"['150.When I prepared the 2012-13 Budget early last year, I made a prudent forecast for government revenue in view of the global economic downturn, sluggish export and local economic slowdown. One year on, my forecast about the economic conditions has proved to be accurate. However, our actual revenue from various items now exceeds the original estimate. Despite the economic fluctuations last year, local enterprises showed strong resilience. Revenue from earnings and profits tax is $24.8 billion higher than the original estimate. With the Government stepping up land sale to increase land supply, revenue from land premium has also increased by $9.1 billion compared to the original estimate. Given hectic trading in the property market in the first three quarters and a bullish stock market in the fourth quarter of this year, stamp duty revenue is $6 billion higher than the original estimate. Moreover, the dividend from the West Rail Property Development Limited is about $10 billion higher than the original estimate. Taking all these into account, the revised estimate for government revenue for 2012-13 is $445.5 billion, $55.2 billion higher than the original estimate. As for government expenditure, I forecast a revised estimate of $380.6 billion, three per cent or $13.1 billion less than the original estimate.', '151.For 2012-13, I forecast a surplus of about $64.9 billion. By 31 March 2013, our fiscal reserves are expected to be $734 billion, equivalent to 36 per cent of GDP or 23 months of government expenditure.']"

It is estimated that capital expenditure will be $88 billion, including $70.1 billion on capital works. I forecast that total government expenditure will reach $440 billion, an increase of 15.6 per cent compared with the revised estimate for 2012-13. Public expenditure will be equivalent to 21.7 per cent of GDP.', '153.The increases in expenditure, both total and recurrent, for 2013-14 far exceed the estimated nominal GDP growth of 5.5 per cent in 2013.

Earnings and profits tax, estimated at $189.4 billion, will be our major source of revenue. Land revenue is estimated at $69 billion.', '155.Taking all these into account, it is expected that a small deficit of about $4.9 billion will be recorded in our accounts in the coming year, and we shall largely achieve fiscal balance. Fiscal reserves are estimated at $729.1 billion by end-March 2014, representing approximately 34 per cent of GDP or equivalent to 20 months of government expenditure.']"

33,2016,Introduction,"['Mr President,', 'I move that the Appropriation Bill 2016 be read a second time.', 'Introduction', '2.This is my ninth year as Financial Secretary. Over the past years, the people of Hong Kong and I together have witnessed the incessant ups and downs in the global economy. I feel blessed that Hong Kong has managed to ride out the storms. We have secured decent economic growth. We have maintained low unemployment and we have managed healthy public finances. I am deeply indebted to the previous generations for the solid foundations that they have built. I am profoundly impressed too by the tenacity of the Hong Kong people.', '3.Openness, diversity, freedom and the rule of law, which have all along been the core values of the people of Hong Kong, have guided our way. Even though the development path of Hong Kong has not been an easy one, our direction is clear and, step by step, we have been charting our course, a course that we call our own. I think we, the Hong Kong people, are proud of our ability to persevere through these turbulent years.', '4.It is only two months since the start of 2016, but the occurrence of incidents in Hong Kong has given rise to grave concerns.', '5.Two weeks ago, in the early hours of the second day of the Lunar New Year, a serious unlawful incident broke out in Mong Kok. A handful of people lost their rationality and attacked the police officers and reporters that were present, provoking a large-scale riot and causing dozens of injuries.', '6.I believe many people share my feelings towards the incident. Distressed and angry, I was perplexed as to why violence had flared in Hong Kong. I was shocked that our city could have turned overnight into such a strange and alien place that I hardly recognised. I was troubled why the core values that we long cherished had been devoured by violence and hatred.', ""7.Acute social conflicts will add uncertainties to the already adverse economic environment. 2016 is an election year. Apart from the Legislative Council (LegCo) By-election to be held four days from today, a LegCo General Election is scheduled to be held in six months' time. We anticipate that political disputes will only intensify over the coming months."", '8.Politics and economics are closely intertwined. Political volatility will unavoidably impact on our economy.', ""9.It is the duty of Government to take on challenges in our society. As Financial Secretary, it is my duty to mobilise resources effectively to maintain Hong Kong's economic development and fiscal health; to support local enterprises, in particular the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), to cope with economic volatilities; and to safeguard the jobs of workers."", ""10.Government should also continue to fortify the economic foundation of Hong Kong, promote diversity, and channel public resources towards improving people's livelihood and supporting the disadvantaged. All sectors should have a fair chance in sharing the fruits of our economic success, and everyone in Hong Kong, regardless of age, gender and race, should be able to unleash their potential and lead a better life through hard work.""]"
34,2016,Economic Performance in 2015,"['Economic Performance in 2015', '11.Export performance of the Asian region was hit by the global economic setback and highly volatile financial markets in 2015. Our exports of goods recorded the first annual decline since 2009, down by 1.7 per cent in real terms. Exports of services dropped by 0.6 per cent, the first annual decrease since 1998. Inbound tourism was weak and visitor arrivals dropped by eight per cent in the fourth quarter, down by 2.5 per cent for the whole year. Retail sales slackened, recording the first annual decrease since 2009.', ""12.Domestic demand was the key driving force of economic growth last year. Although the investment atmosphere turned more cautious, local consumption as well as expenditures on infrastructure and private construction projects remained resilient. These, together with the stimulus effect of the relief measures introduced in last year's Budget, led to an overall economic growth of 2.4 per cent. This is the fourth consecutive year that our economic growth was lower than the annual average of 3.4 per cent over the past ten years. The economy saw significant downward pressure in the latter half of the year, further slowing down to a 1.9 per cent growth in the fourth quarter."", '13.The unemployment rate averaged at a low level of 3.3 per cent for the year as a whole. Wages and income improved generally. Employment earnings for the lowest three income decile groups of full-time employees rose by five to six per cent as compared with the year before. But the recent decline in labour demand in the sectors related to inbound tourism is giving us cause for concern.', ""14.Given the slowdown of the local economy and the mild imported inflation, inflation has dropped for four consecutive years. The headline inflation rate in 2015 was three per cent. Netting out the effects of Government's one-off measures, the underlying inflation rate, at 2.5 per cent, was down by one percentage point from 2014.""]"
35,2016,Economic Outlook for 2016,"['Economic Outlook for 2016', '15.Since the start of 2016, the global economic climate has continued to be unsteady, marked by increasing risks, amid the modest and patchy economic growth of advanced economies, downward pressures on emerging markets and heightened geopolitical tension.', '16.The US Federal Reserve Board started an interest rate increase last year, but the central banks of the Eurozone and Japan have maintained their quantitative easing policies and adopted negative interest rate measures. The divergent monetary policies are causing volatility in the international financial markets and capital flows.', ""17.Emerging economies will be under the dual pressure of falling commodity prices and suppressed financial markets. The Mainland's economy will also face downward pressure."", ""18.As for Hong Kong, local consumption and investor sentiment have been dented by concerns over the uncertainties associated with the US interest rate increases and the dimmer global economic outlook, the lull in external trade and the slowdown in inbound tourism. The pressure may spill over into the job market and business operation of enterprises. The value of total exports of goods and the number of visitor arrivals in Hong Kong have both recorded a year-on-year decline since mid-2015, and the fall is likely to be more severe in 2016. I forecast Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in real terms at one to two per cent in 2016, lower than last year's growth."", '19.Given the subdued global commodity prices, imported inflation is expected to be relatively mild. Slower economic growth and the adjustment in the property market will reduce rental pressure. I forecast that the headline inflation rate for 2016 will be 2.3 per cent, with the underlying inflation rate at two per cent.']"
36,2016,Support Measures,"['Support Measures', '20.The local economy is laden with risks in the year ahead; the outlook is far from promising. We need to take timely and appropriate measures to stimulate the economy, support local enterprises and safeguard employment.']"
37,2016,Helping Small and Medium Enterprises,"['Helping Small and Medium Enterprises', '21.There are 320 000 SMEs in Hong Kong, employing 50 per cent of the private sector workforce. This underscores the role of SMEs as the mainstay of our economy. To gear up for the adversities ahead, I shall provide SMEs with appropriate support measures to stabilise the employment market.', '22.To help SMEs tide over their liquidity needs, I shall introduce three measures –', '23.To ease the burden on enterprises, I shall reduce profits tax for 2015-16 by 75 per cent, subject to a ceiling of $20,000. This proposal will benefit 130 000 taxpayers and reduce government revenue by $1.9 billion.', '24.I shall waive the business registration fees for 2016-17 to benefit 1.3 million business operators. This proposal will reduce government revenue by $2.5 billion.', '25.To enhance the long-term competitiveness of SMEs, I shall launch a Pilot Technology Voucher Programme under the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) to subsidise their use of technological services and solutions to improve productivity and upgrade or transform business processes. The three-year pilot programme will provide, on a matching basis, a maximum subsidy of $200,000 for each eligible SME. The estimated expenditure of this programme is $500 million.', '(a)extend the application period for the ""special concessionary measures"" under the ""SME Financing Guarantee Scheme"" to 28 February 2017;(b)reduce the annual guarantee fee rate for the measures by ten per cent; and(c)remove the minimum guarantee fee for the measures.']"
38,2016,Supporting Tourism,"['Supporting Tourism', '26.Tourism contributes five per cent to our GDP and employs 270 000 people. It provides plenty of job opportunities. For some ten years, tourism and other related industries have experienced rapid growth through the support of the Mainland\'s Individual Visit Scheme and its related policies. The number of inbound visitors has increased to 60 million, four times that of 2003. The local tourism industry is facing keen competition as a result of a weakening external economy, devaluation of currencies of neighbouring places and their relaxation of visa requirements for Mainland tourists since last year. This, coupled with the ""one trip per week"" measure for Shenzhen residents, has caused a drop in visitor arrivals.', '27.Apart from external factors, some recent incidents in Hong Kong are causing concern. These include a handful of people choosing to express their views and political demands using irrational and uncivilised tactics, such as hurling abuses at visitors and kicking their suitcases. Furthermore, problems arising from coerced shopping have been plaguing the tourism sector.', '28.These destructive acts have not only damaged the economy, but have also severely tarnished Hong Kong\'s reputation as a hospitality city internationally. While some have claimed that the acts were committed out of concern for ""local"" interests, their actions are in fact not the kind of behaviour that reflects love for Hong Kong. If they truly care about the development of Hong Kong, they should by no means exercise their right to freedom of expression at the expense of peace in our society and livelihood of innocent citizens.', '29.The tourism industry has entered a period of consolidation. In view of the changing mix and spending pattern of visitors, we need to review the development strategy of our tourism industry. Other than seeking growth in visitor numbers, we should move towards diversified and quality-driven high value-added services, with a view to attracting more high-spending overnight visitors to Hong Kong.', ""30.In light of this new situation, I shall launch short, medium and long-term measures to reduce the industry's costs of operation and enhance Hong Kong's attractiveness and competitiveness. I shall introduce three short-term measures, costing a total of $140 million, for related trades and industries –"", '31.In the medium term, I shall allocate $240 million for Government and the industry to jointly launch five measures –', ""32.In the long run, we shall upgrade our tourism infrastructure. Hong Kong Disneyland will open in 2016 and 2017 respectively a new themed area based on Marvel's Iron Man franchise and a new hotel with a theme dedicated to the spirit of exploration. Government will continue to discuss with the Walt Disney Company the overall development of the theme park. The first hotel in Ocean Park and the Water World in Tai Shue Wan are also scheduled for completion in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Government will continue preparatory work for the tourism projects in Kai Tak and Lantau. The design work for the conference facilities above the proposed Exhibition Station of the Shatin to Central Link is underway."", '33.We shall embark on a pilot scheme on food trucks this year. The concept has attracted wide interest from the community. I shall increase the number of designated spaces for the food trucks to 16. The initiative will enhance the appeal of our tourist attractions and enrich the local food culture.', '(a)waive the licence fees for 1 800 travel agents for one year;(b)waive the licence fees for 2 000 hotels and guesthouses for one year; and(c)waive the licence fees for restaurants and hawkers and fees for restricted food permits for one year, benefiting 27 000 restaurants and operators.', '(a)expand the scale of major events to be held this year, including holding the Formula E Championship for the first time, expanding the venue for the Hong Kong Wine and Dine Festival with more featured themes, extending the race of the Hong Kong Cyclothon to 50 kilometres to attract more overseas cyclists, staging additional Pulse 3D Light Shows at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre, and stepping up publicity for international sports events such as the Rugby Sevens, the tennis open tournament and the golf open tournament;(b)through the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB), re-package Hong Kong\'s tourism image with new promotional videos, launch a new round of publicity for short-haul markets, and step up publicity in the Mainland for quality and honest tours;(c)through the HKTB, assist the industry to open up new visitor sources through various means, including implementation of the matching fund for promoting tourist attractions, promotion of shopping and spending, promotion of MICE (Meetings, Incentive Travels, Conventions and Exhibitions) tourism and ""fly-cruise"" tours, as well as waiving of local traders\' participation fees for overseas promotion fairs;', '(d)through the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong, subsidise small and medium-sized travel agents, on a matching basis, to make use of information technology (IT) so as to enhance the competitiveness of the industry; and(e)continue to promote Hong Kong\'s natural scenery as well as our unique history and culture, including enriching the contents of the Dr Sun Yat-sen Historical Trail with the theme of ""Art across Time"", in tune with PMQ and the former Central Police Station Compound which will open this year.']"
39,2016,Easing Financial Pressure,"['Easing Financial Pressure', ""34.Local consumption has been a key driver for Hong Kong's economic growth in recent years.

First, the basic allowance and the single parent allowance will be raised from $120,000 to $132,000 and the married person's allowance from $240,000 to $264,000. These proposals will benefit 1.93 million taxpayers and reduce tax revenue by $2.9 billion a year."", '36.Second, I shall increase the allowances for maintaining a dependent parent or grandparent.

Together with other spending initiatives in the Budget, they will have a fiscal stimulus effect of boosting GDP for 2016 by 1.1 per cent. ', '38.I have to emphasise that relief measures are different from recurrent expenditure. Relief measures aim to help citizens cope with the current financial pressure and serve as a counter-cyclical measure to preserve economic stability and safeguard employment. These are subject to adjustments in light of the economic and financial position of the year. Recurrent expenditure is deployed for new policies, new services or enhancement of existing services.', '(a)reduce salaries tax and tax under personal assessment for 2015-16 by 75 per cent, subject to a ceiling of $20,000. This proposal will benefit 1.96 million taxpayers and reduce government revenue by $17 billion;(b)waive rates for four quarters of 2016-17, subject to a ceiling of $1,000 per quarter for each rateable property. This will benefit 3.17 million properties and reduce government revenue by $11 billion; and(c)provide an extra allowance to social security recipients, equal to one month of the standard rate Comprehensive Social Security Assistance payments, Old Age Allowance, Old Age Living Allowance or Disability Allowance. This will involve an additional expenditure of $2.8 billion.', '(a)increasing the allowance for maintaining a dependent parent or grandparent aged 60 or above from $40,000 to $46,000. The same increase applies to the additional allowance for taxpayers residing with these parents or grandparents continuously throughout the year;(b)increasing the allowance for maintaining a dependent parent or grandparent aged between 55 and 59 from $20,000 to $23,000. The same increase applies to the additional allowance for taxpayers residing with these parents or grandparents continuously throughout the year; and(c)raising the deduction ceiling for elderly residential care expenses from $80,000 to $92,000 for taxpayers whose parents or grandparents are admitted to residential care homes.']"
40,2016,New Economic Order,"['New Economic Order', '39.Since the 2008 financial tsunami, the global economy has undergone sweeping changes. With the global economic gravity shifting towards the East, emerging markets are playing a much more important and influential role.

78,2012,Introduction,"['Mr President,I move that the Appropriation Bill 2012 be read a second time.', 'Introduction', ""2.This is my fifth Budget, and the last of the current-term Government.  In his Policy Address “From Strength to Strength” last October, the Chief Executive announced measures to relieve people's hardship, improve quality of life and promote social and economic development.  In this Budget, I shall provide the financial resources for the implementation of these measures.3.Maintaining Hong Kong's steady economic growth is a major task of the current Government and also the overall aspiration of our society.  In this term of office, we have faced many ups and downs in the global economy.  The global financial tsunami in 2008 has brought about the most severe recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s, driving the global financial system to the brink of collapse.  Hong Kong was not exempt from this economic predicament.4.Despite the hard hit, Hong Kong's economy has remained resilient and made an earlier recovery from the economic downturn than other advanced economies.  Our economy has achieved a cumulative growth of 19 per cent in real terms over the past five years of extreme volatility, and per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reached an all-time high of US$34,200. 5.What is most encouraging is that the unemployment rate has fallen from its peak of 5.5 per cent in mid-2009 to 3.3 per cent recently, a level which signifies full employment.  Total employment in the local economy has increased by over 180 000 from its trough in 2009.  Income from employment for the lower-income groups registered a growth of 12.5 per cent over the past year.  After making adjustments for inflation, there was still an increase of seven per cent in real terms.  Median household income has risen by 11.1 per cent from $18,000 to $20,000, an increase of 5.1 per cent in real terms, reflecting an improvement in the livelihood of grass roots in the past year. 6.Hong Kong's swift economic recovery has much to do with our flexible economic system and overall competitiveness.  For 18 years in a row, Hong Kong has been ranked the world's freest economy by the Heritage Foundation.  Last year, Hong Kong was ranked the world's most competitive economy by the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland.  Recently, the International Chamber of Commerce has rated Hong Kong as the world's most open market while the World Bank has ranked Hong Kong the second easiest place to do business.  In its 2011 report, the International Monetary Fund concluded that our policies and strategies to counter the financial turmoil contributed to Hong Kong's vigorous rebound from the crisis.  Hong Kong has also received the top triple-A credit rating from the international rating agency Standard & Poor's.7.These assessments reflect the international acceptance of the sound economic fundamentals and effective economic policy framework of Hong Kong, and clearly illustrate that our socio-economic system is on par with international standards.  This is due recognition of Hong Kong's status in the international community.  Good credit ratings have also brought us concrete benefits.  The financing costs for enterprises have come down, making Hong Kong a preferred place for investors to do business, thereby creating more jobs.8.Despite our resilience, we will not lower our sense of crisis.  The international financial markets are still in turmoil.  This, compounded by the unresolved economic troubles and the intricate problems of fiscal deficit and debt crisis in Europe and the US, could deal a more serious blow to the global economy than the 2008 financial tsunami.  We must, therefore, stay alert to unexpected crises and take precautions against any impact on our society.  Whether as individuals, as enterprises or as the community as a whole, we must strengthen our resilience to adversity and prepare ourselves for the challenges ahead.9.To prepare for a potential external economic crisis this year, I shall propose in this Budget a series of measures to counter the risk of economic slowdown.  Underpinned by the strategy of “supporting enterprises to preserve employment and promoting economic development to protect people's livelihood”, these measures will tide enterprises over difficult times, preserve employment and increase people's disposable cash at hand.  Apart from the cushion rendered to the economy, these measures will also help reduce the pressure of inflation on people in need, enabling our community to move on steadily.10.I shall devote resources to all major aspects of our society, including education, medical services, social welfare, housing, infrastructure and various livelihood policy areas while promoting economic development.  These investments can help the coming generation to face new challenges.""]"

80,2012,Economic Performance,"['Economic Performance', '12.The Hong Kong economy has in the past several years weathered an extraordinary period.  At the start of the current term of Government in 2007, Hong Kong boasted a vibrant economy.  Consumer sentiment and investor confidence were strong.  Then came the unprecedented financial tsunami of 2008 triggered by the sub-prime mortgage problem in the US.  Hong Kong was inevitably hit hard.  Not only was there an across-the-board slowdown in external trade and domestic demand, GDP also fell for four consecutive quarters since the second quarter of 2008.  This was coupled with a substantial drop in our exports of goods and a rise in unemployment rate.13.As the Mainland economy picked up its growth and the European and the US economies began to stabilise, our economy started to improve in the second quarter of 2009 and then embarked on a full-fledged recovery in 2010.  In the second quarter of 2010, the size of our real economy surpassed its pre-tsunami peak.  This was followed by a couple of quarters of above-trend year-on-year growth.14.The first quarter of 2011 still saw a year-on-year growth of 7.6 per cent.  Since then, however, as the external environment deteriorated rapidly, our exports plunged, affecting the overall economy.  Economic growth slowed from 5.3 per cent in the second quarter to 4.3 per cent in the third quarter and further to three per cent in the fourth.  For 2011 as a whole, GDP grew by five per cent in real terms, the lower range of the forecast that I made last August.15.On the trade front, in 2010 with a growth of 17.3 per cent in total exports of goods, we swiftly regained all ground lost in 2009 when total exports of goods plunged by 12.7 per cent, the biggest annual drop on record.  However, exports of goods went down sharply in mid-2011 due to slackening demand as a result of the unstable economic recovery in Europe and the US and the worsening sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone.  The third quarter even saw negative year-on-year growth, the first since the fourth quarter of 2009.  Exports steadied somewhat in the fourth quarter, and the growth for 2011 as a whole was 3.6 per cent in real terms.16.Domestic demand was also severely hit during the financial tsunami, but began to rebound in the second half of 2009 as the external environment stabilised and the Government’s measures to counter the crisis took effect.  Domestic demand gathered pace in 2010 and remained resilient in 2011, thereby rendering a key driving force of overall economic growth.  Riding on an improving employment situation and rising incomes, private consumption expenditure maintained our growth momentum in all four quarters of last year.  Overall investment also continued to expand last year.  Nevertheless, the highly uncertain external environment has weighed on business confidence.  Enterprises have become more cautious recently.17.Turning to inflation.  The economy slowed down in 2009, and we experienced a few months of deflation.  To tackle the financial crisis, major advanced economies introduced quantitative easing.  They reduced interest rates to a super-low level near zero, leading to a surge in the prices of food and commodities in the international market.  The ultra-loose monetary environment brought large inflows of funds into Asia and Hong Kong in 2009, further fuelling inflation and increasing the risk of asset-price bubbles in the region.  Inflationary pressure on Hong Kong rose gradually in 2010.18.Inflation became more evident in 2011.  The underlying inflation rate for the year averaged 5.3 per cent, a marked rise from the 1.7 per cent in 2010.  With the slowdown in local economic growth and the gradual decline in food inflation in the Mainland, the rising trend in Hong Kong’s inflation tapered in the fourth quarter of 2011.19.There have been marked fluctuations in the property market in the past few years.  Triggered by the financial tsunami, property prices experienced a sharp drop in late 2008, but began to surge since early 2009 surpassing the peak in 1997.  This is attributed to the economic recovery and the exceptionally low interest rates, coupled with the relatively tight supply of residential flats.  To ensure a healthy and stable development of the property market, we introduced measures in four areas, namely (1) increasing flat supply; (2) curbing property speculation; (3) preventing expansion in mortgage lending; and (4) ensuring transparency in the property market.  Our aim is to prevent the risk of asset-price bubbles from worsening, and ensure the stability of our property market, financial system and macro economy.20.I am pleased to see that these measures have achieved some results.  Speculative activities have abated, the average                 loan-to-value ratio of new residential mortgages has been falling gradually, and flat prices have started to come down since last June.  Despite the recent stabilisation of the property market, the low-interest environment persists, and the developed countries may again resort to quantitative easing policies to boost their sluggish economies.  I shall, therefore, continue the strategy that has proven to be effective in facilitating the healthy and stable development of the property market.21.Despite the sharp swings in the global economic and financial environment over the past few years, we withstood the severe blow dealt by the financial tsunami in 2008 and 2009, and achieved an above-trend growth in 2010 and 2011.  In the third quarter of 2011, however, the economic situation in Europe and  the US became unstable again due to the worsening sovereign debt crisis in Europe.  This threatened the entire European banking industry and several larger European economies, including Italy and Spain.  Worse still, the unprecedented downgrade of the US’s sovereign rating has caused wild gyrations in the financial markets.  Yet, European countries and the US are set to step up their fiscal austerity measures, raising concern about a possible double-dip recession in the global economy.22.We implemented a package of fiscal stimulus, job creation and relief measures worth nearly $110 billion in the three fiscal years from 2008-09 to 2010-11.  On the back of our strategy of “stabilising the financial system, supporting enterprises and preserving employment”, the downward pressure brought by the financial tsunami on Hong Kong’s economy eased significantly, and the pace of worsening in the job market also slowed down.23.The relief measures adopted by the Government have increased people’s cash in hand and provided timely assistance to those in need.  Short-term jobs, temporary posts and internship opportunities have been offered to help people in need change jobs and better equip themselves for returning to the labour market in better times.  Furthermore, the Government’s years of heavy investment in infrastructure has laid a solid foundation for the future and created ample job opportunities.24.To tackle the credit crunch triggered by the global financial crisis, we also introduced a series of countermeasures, including the Special Loan Guarantee Scheme and the enhanced Small and Medium Enterprises Loan Guarantee Scheme.  Since 2008, loans worth more than $100 billion have been approved, benefiting over 20 000 enterprises and indirectly preserving 350 000 jobs.25.During the economic recession in the wake of the financial tsunami, we lost only 62 000 jobs, less than half the number lost during the Asian financial turmoil.  This reflects that our measures have brought about the positive effect of preserving social and economic stability through supporting employment.   The unemployment rate even dropped to a 13-year low of 3.2 per cent in mid-2011.  However, as the external environment worsened in the second half of the year, the unemployment rate rebounded slightly to 3.3 per cent towards the end of 2011, which still represented full employment.26.In 2011-12, Hong Kong was under the threat of inflation.  We introduced an array of measures worth over $60 billion with a view to combating inflation and leaving wealth with our people.  Some of the measures are still working effectively.  With appropriate measures in place, we have alleviated the impact of economic cycles on the public.27.The financial tsunami that broke out at the end of 2008 is far from over and is still battering the global economy.  In the face of adversity, our people have demonstrated perseverance and wisdom.  Drawing on our resources, the Government has introduced a series of strategic measures to stabilise our economy and help those in need for the sustained development of our society.  These joint efforts have helped us come through crisis after crisis.']"
81,2012,Economic Outlook for 2012,"['Economic Outlook for 2012', '28.Given the bleak economic prospects in Europe and the US, the risk of a sharp deterioration of the external environment is increasing.  Despite their relatively strong economic fundamentals, Asian and emerging market economies have seen a noticeable slowdown in their growth momentum recently.  As a result, our external demand has been faltering.  I am not optimistic about Hong Kong’s export performance in the first half of this year, and if exports of goods were to plunge in the first quarter, the overall economy might take a downturn in that quarter.29.Fortunately, many Asian economies have started to ease their monetary policies, and there is also much policy room for the Mainland to bolster economic growth.  So long as the European debt crisis does not escalate into a full blown crisis, the Asian region should be able to serve as an anchor for the global economy.  Hong Kong’s external trade may also see some improvement in the second half of this year.30.I shall introduce measures worth nearly $80 billion in this year’s Budget to better prepare our people for the difficult time ahead.  Besides supporting enterprises and people in meeting challenges, these measures will help ease the burden of inflation on people.  This is a strong package of measures and would help stimulate the economy 1.5 percentage points in 2012.  The measures, coupled with other positive factors including our strong economic fundamentals, the robust performance of the tourism industry and a wealth of infrastructure projects being rolled out, will help tide us over a difficult and thorny year.  Even so, economic growth will inevitably be lower than the average growth rate over the past decade. I forecast GDP growth of one to three per cent in real terms for 2012.                    31.The range between the upper and lower boundaries of this forecast is larger than the usual one percentage point.  This reflects the unusually large degree of uncertainties in the external environment this year, especially when the European debt crisis is still twisting and turning.  It is difficult to predict with any certainty the possibility of a severe recession in Europe and, if so, the precise ramifications on Asia.32.As regards inflation, with global food and commodity prices retreating from peaks and local costs easing off as a result of economic slowdown, I believe the inflation rate would ease quite visibly in the second half of 2012.  The average underlying inflation rate for the year is expected to drop from 5.3 per cent in 2011 to four per cent this year.  The headline inflation rate for 2012 is estimated at 3.5 per cent after taking account of the effects of the one-off measures I am about to propose.']"
82,2012,Getting Hong Kong Well Prepared,"['Getting Hong Kong Well Prepared', '33.Faced with so many uncertainties, we must get well prepared for our future.  While short-term relief measures are essential to stabilising our economy and tiding our community over difficult times, we must also seize this moment when our financial position is sound to invest in our future.  I shall propose measures to address this issue in six respects, namely supporting enterprises, preserving employment, caring for people, stabilising our financial system, increasing land supply and strengthening our social capital.']"
83,2012,Supporting Enterprises,"['Supporting Enterprises', '34.First of all, lending support to enterprises.  I am deeply concerned about the possible hardship small and medium enterprises (SMEs) may suffer in times of economic downturn.  Making up the vast majority of the enterprises in Hong Kong, SMEs employ over 1.2 million staff, representing half of the total number of employees in the private sector.  We must do our utmost to help SMEs get through difficult times in order to minimise unemployment.  I shall now propose a series of supportive measures for them.35.To address the financing difficulties faced by SMEs, the Government introduced the Special Loan Guarantee Scheme in 2008.  With the recovery of the economy, the Scheme ceased to accept applications on 1 January 2011.  It was replaced by a market-oriented sustainable SME Financing Guarantee Scheme launched by the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (HKMC).  The new Scheme offers financing guarantee services catered for SMEs and helps reduce banks’ lending risks, thereby contributing to maintaining the stability of our banking system.36.Given the fluctuations in the external economic environment in the coming year, SMEs may have to face financing difficulties once again as a result of the credit crunch.  After taking into account suggestions by SMEs and the banking sector, we propose to substantially enhance the existing SME Financing Guarantee Scheme by introducing a number of concessionary measures.37.Under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme, the maximum loan guarantee ratio is 70 per cent.  The concessionary measures will include a new loan guarantee product with a higher ratio of 80 per cent for which the Government will provide a total guarantee commitment of $100 billion.  While the annual guarantee fee for a loan with a guarantee ratio of 70 per cent currently stands at 32 to 35 per cent of the loan facility’s interest rate, that for a loan with a guarantee ratio of 80 per cent under the new concessionary measures will be lowered to 10 to 12 per cent.  Take a $1 million loan at an interest rate of five per cent per annum as an example.  The annual guarantee fee for a loan with a guarantee ratio of 70 per cent is $16,000 under the current Scheme.  The annual guarantee fee for a loan with a guarantee ratio of 80 per cent under the concessionary measures will only be $5,000, 70 per cent less when compared to the current rate.  The concessionary scheme will be open for application for nine months.  Taking into account the anticipated default rate, the estimated government expenditure will be about $11 billion.38.The increase in loan guarantee ratio under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme will enhance lending institutions’ confidence in offering loans to SMEs to meet their financing needs.  The significant reduction in guarantee fee will also reduce the burden on SMEs.  We consider that a limited guarantee fee will ensure appropriate risk sharing among lending institutions, enterprises and Government, and hence the proper use of public money.  To tide enterprises over difficult times, the HKMC will launch the concessionary measures as soon as possible, and discuss with lending institutions and enterprises ways to simplify the Scheme’s existing procedures.39.In times of economic downturn, exporters will face a shrinking overseas market as well as increasing risks of default in payment by buyers.  In December 2011, the Hong Kong Export Credit Insurance Corporation (ECIC), with the full support of the Government, introduced three enhanced measures, namely (1) waiving its annual policy fee for one year; (2) providing exporters with free buyer credit assessment service; and (3) expediting the assessment of small credit limit applications.40.To further assist SMEs, the ECIC will introduce new terms in their insurance policy, which will include special concessions for SMEs, on 6 February.  For example, SME policyholders will be allowed to insure their exports only for places and buyers of their choice under specified circumstances, and will be offered various premium discounts.  Moreover, the ECIC will extend the sales-by policy launched in March last year to contracts between Hong Kong exporters’ overseas or Mainland subsidiaries of which the Hong Kong policyholders have control, and their buyers.  I believe that these new initiatives will further help SMEs maintain their competitiveness, tap into emerging markets and ease their financial pressure.41.In the face of the worsening external economic environment, we need to help our enterprises by reducing their operating costs and enhancing our competitiveness so as to protect employment.  To this end, I propose four measures as follows:', '\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000(1)', 'Waiving the business registration fees for 2012-13 to benefit all business operators.  This proposal will cost the Government $1.9 billion;', '\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000(2)', 'Reducing profits tax for 2011-12 by 75 per cent, subject to a ceiling of $12,000.  The reduction will be reflected in the taxpayers’ final tax payable for 2011-12.  The proposal will benefit all taxpayers who are liable to profits tax, the number of which is near 120 000.  This proposal will cost the Government $1.12 billion;', '\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000(3)', 'Halving the charges for import and export declarations.  We estimate that each enterprise engaging in import and export businesses will save $9,000 a year on average.  This will cost the Government $750 million a year; and', '\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000(4)', 'Abolishing capital duty levied on local companies.  This is to encourage investors to set up companies in Hong Kong to raise capital and expand their business, thereby enhancing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as a corporate domicile.  This proposal will cost the Government $90 million a year.']"
84,2012,Preserving Employment,"['Preserving Employment', '42.Second, we will strive to preserve employment.  Overall employment in Hong Kong is largely stable with the unemployment rate standing at a relatively low level.  However, I expect the unemployment rate to reverse its downtrend as the economy slows down.  We should therefore be well prepared so that timely measures can be taken to lessen any impact on the community when there is an upward pressure on the unemployment rate.43.We shall continue with the strategy which helped us tackle the 2008 financial tsunami.  We shall, on the one hand, stabilise the employment market through the supportive measures for enterprises I have just mentioned, and provide suitable employment support and training directly for our working population on the other.44.Take the construction industry as an example.  Heavy investment in infrastructure projects by this Government has brought about a substantial increase in demand for construction workers, and the employment situation has been improving in the industry.  The unemployment rate for the industry in the latest quarter is 5.2 per cent, far below the post-tsunami peak of 12.8 per cent in 2008.45.In 2010, I earmarked $100 million to implement various initiatives to attract more people to join the construction industry.  These measures have started to deliver results.  The construction workforce has grown to its present strength of more than 300000, easing the problem of an ageing workforce and succession gap faced by the industry in recent years.  To ride the wave, I propose to earmark another $220 million to support the Construction Industry Council in enhancing manpower training.  The aim is to bring fresh blood into the industry to meet the demand of future infrastructure developments.46.The catering and retail industries have been providing employment opportunities for the grass roots.  The Labour Department’s Recruitment Centre for the Catering Industry and Recruitment Centre for the Retail Industry will strengthen liaison with employers in both industries to better serve their recruitment needs, and disseminate up-to-date information on the employment market to job seekers.  In addition, the Employees Retraining Board (ERB) will continue to provide courses to help people who are seeking employment or changing jobs to join the catering and retail trades.  Courses are also offered to employees of both trades to upgrade their skills.47.The Vocational Training Council will set up an International Cuisine College for people aspiring to become professional chefs in international cuisines.  Apart from providing vocational training to those who wish to pursue a career in the catering industry, the College will offer multiple study pathways for youngsters.  The College, to be established with a capital expenditure of $500 million, is expected to admit its first cohort of students in the 2014/15 academic year.  It will provide more than 2000 places a year.48.With the economy slowing down and the unemployment rate reversing its downtrend, certain groups of people in society will be the first to bear the brunt.  We shall soon inject $100 million into the Enhancing Employment of People with Disabilities through Small Enterprises Project, under which funding is granted to non-government organisations to set up small enterprises employing people with disabilities. We shall continue the Youth Pre-employment Training Programme and Youth Work Experience and Training Scheme, Employment Programme for the Middle-aged, and Work Orientation and Placement Scheme to facilitate the employment of young people, the middle-aged and the disabled.  These special employment programmes, which involve an annual expenditure of $175 million, benefit 20000 job seekers with employment difficulties each year.49.The ERB will offer 130000 training places in 2012-13, and allocate additional resources for the provision of placement-tied courses for the unemployed and people seeking employment.  Adequate resources have also been reserved for providing an additional 30000 training places.  This will enable the ERB to respond promptly to the demand from training providers for increasing or redeploying the places to meet contingencies.50.The Government will remain vigilant against any serious deterioration in the economic situation and its impact on employment.  When necessary, we shall provide further funding to adjust and enhance the relevant employment programmes.']"
85,2012,Caring for People’s Livelihood,"['Caring for People’s Livelihood', '51.Third, we need to care for people’s livelihood.  The downside risks to the economy will inevitably affect people from all sectors of society.  Despite the downturn, we do not intend to reduce government expenditure because this will affect the quality of our service to the public.  On the contrary, we shall continue to allocate resources to recurrent items relating to people’s livelihood.  We shall, as in the past, adopt fiscal stimulus measures to help those in need by providing them with appropriate services and facilities.52.Education, health and social welfare are the three policy areas of wide public concern that currently take up the largest share of government expenditure.  I would like to give a brief description of our initiatives before explaining the expenditure of the current-term Government in these areas.53.First, let us look at education.Our total expenditure is over $79 billion in 2012-13, out of which nearly $60 billion is recurrent expenditure.  This represents an increase of seven per cent over the recurrent expenditure in 2011-12.  In the coming year, I propose to launch the following new measures:', '\u3000\u3000\u3000(1)', 'Earmarking $1 billion to implement a new programme under the new senior secondary academic structure modelled on Project Yi Jin.  The aim is to provide an alternative pathway for students to acquire a formal qualification other than the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education examinations to be held for the first time this year.  Students are encouraged to choose among different pathways in accordance with interests and aptitudes.  With the parallel development of the  publicly-funded sector and the self-financing sector, we estimate that over 75 000 places will be provided at post-secondary level and 35000 continuing education and vocational education and training places will be offered this year.  There will be adequate places to accommodate 100000 school graduates in the double cohort year;', '\u3000\u3000\u3000(2)', 'Allocating $2.5 billion to launch the sixth Matching Grant Scheme (MGS) in the post-secondary education sector to help institutions tap more funding sources, improve the quality of education and foster a philanthropic culture.  The five rounds of the MGS launched since 2003 have helped institutions secure additional resources of $14.1 billion, comprising $9.2 billion private donations and $4.9 billion government matching grants.  For the first time, the proposed sixth MGS will cover all statutory and approved post-secondary institutions to further consolidate their development; and', '\u3000\u3000\u3000(3)', 'Making two separate injections of $1 billion each, bringing the total to $2 billion, into the HKSAR Government Scholarship Fund and Self-financing Post-secondary Education Fund to establish more scholarships or award schemes for outstanding students.  In the 2011/12 academic year, 2000 tertiary students with excellent academic performance were awarded scholarships. Injecting $2 billion into the two funds will give recognition to more students with outstanding academic performance or remarkable achievements in other areas such as sports, fine art, science and technology and community services.  This will encourage their all-rounded development and pursuit of excellence.  We estimate that a total of 10000 students will benefit each year from the scholarships and award schemes to be established subject to the details of the schemes.', '54.As for health, we shall increase our recurrent expenditure for the coming year by eight per cent to nearly $45 billion to provide medical services of a higher quality for the public while the total expenditure in 2012-13 is over $59 billion.  On capital investment, North Lantau Hospital and the expansion of Tseung Kwan O Hospital will be completed this year and next year.  We shall continue to pursue the construction of a number of new public hospitals including Tin Shui Wai Hospital and the Centre of Excellence in Paediatrics at Kai Tak, and the expansion of the United Christian Hospital.  We shall also redevelop Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) and Kwong Wah Hospital (KWH) in the coming year.  The redeveloped QMH will provide upgraded accident and emergency services and cardiology services.  For KWH, redevelopment will involve revamping existing medical facilities, and strengthening the hospital’s Chinese and Western medicines shared care services, including Chinese medicine in-patient service.55.The Samaritan Fund assists patients in need by providing full or partial subsidies for self-financed drugs and medical items required in the course of medical treatment.  The subsidies will be provided according to the applicants’ financial conditions.  To make better use of the Fund, I propose to provide allowances when calculating the total value of disposable assets in the means test.  I also propose to simplify the tiers of patients’ contribution ratio for drug expenses so that more people will benefit from the subsidy, and patients already receiving partial subsidies will have the burden of drug expenses further eased.  Take a four-member family with an annual disposable income of $100,000 and disposable capital of $400,000 as an example.  If the drug expenses required by the sick family member are $100,000 per year, no financial assistance will be provided under the current scheme.  Upon introduction of the new measures, the family member will receive a subsidy of $90,000.  This will help reduce much of the financial burden on the family.56.It is hard to estimate accurately the future financial needs of the Samaritan Fund.  However, taking into account its escalating expenditure over recent years, and the potential increase in expenditure arising from the implementation of the new measures, I propose to inject $10 billion into the Fund to provide adequate provisions for its operation in the next ten years or so.  The injection will also give the Fund more headroom to increase the types of subsidised drugs in accordance with clinical protocols and scientific evidence, benefiting more people in need.57.As for social welfare, total expenditure for 2012-13 is over $48 billion, out of which $44 billion is recurrent expenditure.  This represents an increase of nine per cent over recurrent expenditure in 2011-12.  For the coming year, I propose two measures to enhance elderly care.  First, we shall increase the recurrent funding for Dementia Supplement by $137 million.  This will allow eligible residential care homes and day care centres or units for the elderly to have more resources for engaging professional staff (including occupational therapists, nurses and social workers) or procuring related professional services for the provision of proper care to every demented service user.58.Second, we shall allocate $900 million under the Lotteries Fund to improve the physical setting and facilities of as many as 250 district elderly community centres, neighbourhood elderly centres and social centres for the elderly across the territory.  This will enhance the community support services for elderly people and their carers.59.To help ease the pressure of the economic downturn on our community and including the measures the Chief Executive proposed in his Policy Address, I shall introduce the following seven one-off measures:', '\u3000\u3000\u3000(1)', 'Waiving rates for 2012-13 Note1, subject to a ceiling of $2,500 per quarter for each rateable property.

86,2012,Stabilising the Financial System,"['Stabilising the Financial System', '62.Fourth, we shall seek to maintain the stability of our financial system.  Despite the wild fluctuations in the international financial markets over the past year, Hong Kong’s financial markets managed to operate in an orderly manner, and financial institutions remained strong and sound.  Banks’ capital adequacy ratios have been maintained well above international requirements, and liquidity ratios at relatively high levels.63.But with the global economy facing ever-increasing downside risks, any deterioration in the European sovereign debt crisis will dampen market sentiment, which may set off massive repatriation of funds from emerging markets.  Hong Kong can hardly be immune from the impact and may suffer from an outflow of funds from the Hong Kong dollar.64.The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and other regulators have introduced a number of regulatory measures to enhance the resilience of the financial system.  Such measures include strengthening banks’ credit and liquidity risk management, increasing the level of banks’ regulatory reserve, and introducing four rounds of prudential regulatory requirements on mortgage loans.  The regulators will continue to ask banks, securities brokers and insurance companies to strengthen their risk management.  The foreign currency reserves the HKMA accumulated from capital inflows two years ago will serve as a buffer against the risk of an abrupt reversal in capital flows, and help maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and avoid excessive interest rate volatility.65.I shall work jointly with our regulators to keep a close watch on the development of the global financial markets.  Where necessary, appropriate measures will be taken to ease any possible strain on Hong Kong’s financial system and maintain the stability of our monetary and overall financial system.']"
87,2012,Increasing Land Supply,"['Increasing Land Supply', '66.Fifth, we shall continue to increase land supply.  I shall now elaborate on the latest developments in the supply of private housing, public housing and commercial sites as well as urban renewal.', 'Land Supply', '67.Our resolve to increase land supply and create a land reserve is beyond question.  To ensure that land supply will not be affected by economic cycles or fluctuations of the property market, the Steering Committee on Housing Land Supply that I chair will continue to expand land resources in a multi-pronged manner.  This will facilitate the stable development of our property market and meet the needs for our social and economic development.68.From our rough estimates, the land use studies and reviews being conducted by the Planning Department cover 2 500 hectares of land, equivalent to one-tenth of the developed land in Hong Kong.  We have started public engagement exercises on the planning for new development areas in north east New Territories, Hung Shui Kiu, Tung Chung and various quarry sites, reclamation on an appropriate scale outside Victoria Harbour, and development of caverns.  In the long-term interest of Hong Kong, we look forward to an early consensus in the community on these issues.69.Appropriately increasing the development intensity of land will help increase the supply of residential flats within a relatively short span of time.  While doing so, we should take into account the public’s aspirations for a quality city environment.  We should make optimal use of the development potential of railway-property projects.  After discussing with the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL), we have identified the West Rail Kam Sheung Road Station and Pat Heung Depot and the adjacent rural area as having enormous potential for providing more housing land.  The Development Bureau, in collaboration with the MTRCL, will soon launch public consultation on two property projects above the West Rail Kam Sheung Road Station and Pat Heung Depot.  It is estimated that these projects will provide about 8 700 flats, giving impetus to the development of the southern part of Kam Tin.  We shall also invite the MTRCL to explore other opportunities for development along railways.', 'Private Housing', '70.I shall now turn to private properties.  Since last year, apart from retaining the Application List system, we have initiated land sale in a proactive manner and announced our land sale programme in advance on a quarterly basis in response to the market’s keen demand for residential sites.  In this financial year, the number of residential sites sold and to be sold by the Government, including those in the land sale programme for the fourth quarter already announced, amounts to 27.  The sites will provide about 7900 flats in total. We have stipulated flat size restrictions for three of those sites for the provision of 2300 small and medium-sized flats, and flat number restrictions for five other sites, which will provide at least 3800 flats.  These arrangements will help increase the supply of small and medium-sized flats and ensure an adequate supply of residential flats.71.Turning to West Rail property projects.  The developments at the three sites at Nam Cheong, Tsuen Wan West TW5 (Cityside) and Tsuen Wan West TW5 (Bayside) will provide not less than 6600 flats in total, of which 65 per cent are small and medium-sized flats with a saleable floor area of 50 square metres or below.  The first two sites have already been sold.  The last will be re-tendered in due course.72.In 2011-12, through quarterly land sale programmes, the three West Rail property projects I have just mentioned, urban renewal projects, lease modifications or land exchanges by private developers, and private redevelopment projects not subject to lease modifications or land exchanges, sites on which over 20000 private residential units can be built were provided.  This met the target set by the Chief Executive.73.The Government will continue to increase land supply in the coming year.  In the Land Sale Programme for 2012-13 to be announced tomorrow, we shall include in the Application List 47 residential sites, of which half are new sites.  They will provide some 13500 units.  We shall follow the practice of announcing land sale programmes in advance on a quarterly basis, and stipulate flat number or flat size restrictions in land sale in the light of market conditions and the characteristics of individual sites.74.The major sources of land supply for private residential housing in the coming year include the Government’s Land Sale Programme for the coming year, four property projects along the West Rail, three property projects owned by the MTRCL, redevelopment projects of the Urban Renewal Authority (URA), lease modifications or land exchanges, and private redevelopments not subject to lease modifications or land exchanges.  It is estimated that the housing land supply in aggregate in the coming year will provide some 30000 private residential flats.', 'Public Housing', '75.Turning to public housing.  The Government’s public housing policy is to provide public rental housing (PRH) for low-income families who cannot afford private rental accommodation.  According to the latest Public Housing Construction Programme of the Housing Authority, the total production of PRH flats will be 75000 in the five-year period starting from 2011-12.  Our aim is to maintain the average waiting time for general PRH applicants at around three years.  To this end, the Housing Authority will adjust and increase the production volume when necessary.76.We shall continue to identify suitable sites for public housing development in various districts.  The Housing Authority will develop the sites to their full potential to maximise public housing supply by relaxing restrictions on plot ratio and building height.  This will be done without compromising the living environment.', 'New Home Ownership Scheme and My Home Purchase Plan', '77.The Chief Executive announced in last year’s Policy Address a new policy for the resumption of the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS).  The new scheme will offer flats with a saleable floor area of about 400 to 500 square feet to families with a monthly household income under $30,000, mainly first-time home buyers.  The Housing Authority has initially identified six sites in Sha Tin, Tsuen Wan, Kwai Tsing and Yuen Long for the first batch of developments under the new HOS.  The respective District Councils will be consulted shortly.  The Housing Authority has also initiated discussions on the implementation details of the scheme, including pricing principles and future premium payment arrangements.78.In addition to the new policy for the resumption of the HOS, the Government, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Housing Society, will continue to implement the My Home Purchase Plan (MHPP) to provide “no frills” small and medium-sized rental flats for families with a relatively higher monthly income of up to about $40,000 so that they will have time to save up.  The Government has already earmarked a number of sites for 5000 MHPP flats.  The first development project at Tsing Yi will provide 1000 small and medium-sized flats.  They will be completed in 2014 and application for pre-letting will begin in the fourth quarter of this year.  The second development project at Sha Tin will provide 700 small and medium-sized flats.', 'Supply of Business Sites', '79.Office rental in Hong Kong has remained high over the past few years.  While the soaring rental is an indication of thriving economic activities, it also drives up the cost of doing business in Hong Kong.  This will make Hong Kong less attractive to foreign investors and undermine the competitiveness of local enterprises.  Therefore, we must seek to maintain a stable and sufficient supply of business sites.80.Last year, the sale of seven sites in various districts for commercial/business use provided an additional 320000 square metres for office or other commercial uses.  Under the policy to revitalise industrial buildings, by the end of 2011, the Lands Department had approved 40 applications for redevelopment or wholesale conversion of buildings, releasing 410000 square metres of floor area for commercial use.81.To sharpen Hong Kong’s competitive edge, we must focus not only on the supply of office space, but also on the development of new core business districts, including Kowloon East announced in last year’s Policy Address. Taking advantage of the future office development at Kai Tak and the revitalisation or redevelopment of industrial buildings in Kwun Tong and Kowloon Bay, Kowloon East will develop into another major business district, with office gross floor area increasing from the current 1.4million square metres to 5.4million square metres. The Kowloon East Development Office tasked with this project is expected to be established in the first half of this year.82.These brand new office nodes, however, will by no means replace the established Central Business District (CBD).  Given their geographical advantages and well-equipped facilities, Grade A offices within the CBD are still in keen demand.  To free Grade A office space currently taken up by the Government for commercial use, we shall continue to reduce our leased office space in Central and Admiralty.  The total gross floor area of office premises leased by the Government in both districts has reduced from 11 500 square metres five years ago to the present level of 4300 square metres, and is expected to further reduce to 230 square metres in 2015.83.We shall continue to relocate government departments from core business districts where appropriate.  The Legislative Council has approved an appropriation of nearly $800 million for the relocation of a Water Supplies Department facility in Mong Kok to an industrial building in New Territories West.  The Mong Kok site, together with the neighbouring Food and Environmental Hygiene Department depot and temporary car park, will be developed into a commercial property.  It will provide 65000 square metres of office gross floor area according to our preliminary estimate.84.This Council has also approved another funding of $2.6 billion for the construction of the Trade and Industry Tower at the Kai Tak Development Area.  Upon its completion by the end of 2014, 18 000 square metres of gross floor area in the Trade and Industry Department Tower in Mong Kok will be released for commercial use.  Also in the pipeline are the relocation of the Department of Justice to the Main and East Wings of the old Central Government Offices, development of a government office building in West Kowloon and the phased relocation of the departments in the three government office buildings at the Wan Chai waterfront.', 'Urban Renewal', '85.Building dilapidation, unauthorised building works and “sub-divided units” were issues of grave public concern last year.  While a series of measures have been implemented by the Government to improve building safety, many people still consider that speeding up the redevelopment of old buildings a more effective solution.  This will also release urban sites for housing development.  We have asked the URA to assume its new roles as set out under the new Urban Renewal Strategy announced last February.  Apart from initiating redevelopment projects on its own as “implementer”, the URA will take forward “demand-led” schemes and act as “facilitator” to help owners of old buildings carry out redevelopment.86.Since its establishment, the URA has been focusing on residential redevelopment.  We need to accelerate the renewal of old industrial areas to release more sites for residential or commercial development.  Many industrial buildings are situated on lots already rezoned for other uses and can benefit from the policy initiatives of revitalisation.  However, their redevelopment is held back by multiple ownership.  The same problem of multiple ownership in industrial buildings also presents the greatest challenge to Energizing Kowloon East.87.In view of this,I propose to invite the URA to launch redevelopment projects of industrial buildings in the form of a pilot scheme. After trying out the pilot scheme,we shall review the situation and consult the public before deciding on the level of long-term commitment of the URA on the redevelopment of industrial buildings.  Subject to the results of the pilot scheme, I shall propose to make another injection to the URA when necessary.  The additional resources will ensure that the URA’s task of improving the living environment of people residing in old buildings will not be affected if the URA becomes heavily involved in the redevelopment of industrial buildings in future.']"
88,2012,Strengthening Our Social Capital,"['Strengthening Our Social Capital', '88.We strive for economic development to better people’s livelihood.  To this end, while following our established strategy of “Market Leads, Government Facilitates”, we endeavour to provide a platform for building social capital so that the “big society” between the market and the Government may flourish.89.The Community Investment and Inclusion Fund was set up in 2002 to promote social capital development through encouraging mutual support in the neighbourhood, community participation and cross-sectoral partnerships.  Since its establishment, the Fund has subsidised 238 projects rolled out by more than 130 organisations involving over 560 000 participants.  There have been notable achievements in capacity building, enhancement of interpersonal relationship and development of community networks.  I propose to inject an additional $200 million into the Fund to ensure that it can continue to perform its social function in furthering social capital development at the district level.90.Since its establishment in 2011, the Community Care Fund (CCF) has launched over ten assistance programmes, benefiting several hundred thousands of people.  Such programmes include the provision of a lunch subsidy for students from low-income families, and a subsidy for Hospital Authority’s patients using specified self-financed cancer drugs.  Initiatives can be implemented on a pilot basis under the CCF to help the Government identify measures to be incorporated into its regular assistance and service programmes.  Upon examining the effectiveness of individual programmes, we shall decide the appropriate ones to be incorporated into the Government’s regular assistance programmes, subject to the views of the Steering Committee on the CCF.  I shall make the corresponding financial arrangements.91.Last year, I asked the HKMC to study the feasibility of establishing a microfinance scheme in Hong Kong to assist people who may wish to start their own businesses or take self-enhancement training but cannot do so due to a lack of financial means or difficulties in obtaining loans from traditional finance sources.  Having considered the results of the study, I decided to commission the HKMC to introduce a three-year pilot scheme in co-ordination and collaboration with banks, voluntary organisations and other stakeholders.  The scheme will be operated on a self-financing basis with supporting services provided to make microfinance more viable.  The maximum loan amount of the pilot scheme will be capped at $100 million tentatively.  The target borrowers are business starters, self-employed persons and people who wish to receive training, enhance their skills or obtain professional qualifications for self-improvement.  The repayment period will be as long as five years and the interest rate will be set with reference to that of the personal loans charged by banks in general.  The HKMC will announce the details in due course.']"

90,2012,Capitalising on Our Competitive Edge,"['Capitalising on Our Competitive Edge', '93.We must take advantage of our existing competitive edge to promote economic development.  The National 12th Five-Year Plan has unprecedentedly included a dedicated chapter on Hong Kong and Macao.  This spells out the functions and positioning of the Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions in the development strategy of our country.94.Last August, Mr Li Keqiang, Vice-Premier of the State Council, announced the Central Government’s package of more than 30 specific policy measures to support our economic, trade and financial co-operation with the Mainland.  We shall actively take forward these measures.95.The continued liberalisation of the Mainland economy has presented Hong Kong with an opportunity to further develop its economy.  Take the capital market as an example.  Mainland enterprises flock to list in Hong Kong, attracting large international capital inflows.  This has made Hong Kong the premier location for capital formation for Mainland enterprises seeking to raise funds overseas.  After more than two decades of development, the Mainland has gradually moved from seeking to attract capital inflows to encouraging its enterprises and funds to go global, a process that is accelerating.  Hong Kong should brace itself for another restructuring of its capital market.  Among other things, we should improve our market infrastructure, seek to enhance the market connectivity of the Mainland and Hong Kong and increase our market capacity.96.On the promotion of Hong Kong-Taiwan co-operation, the Hong Kong-Taiwan Economic and Cultural Cooperation and Promotion Council and the Taiwan-Hong Kong Economic and Cultural Co-operation Council are actively following up on the agreed priority co-operation areas, including medical and health co-operation, arrangements for avoidance of double taxation on shipping income, and further strengthening bilateral economic exchanges between the two places.  In late December last year, both sides signed an air services arrangement, which increased the flight frequency, number of destinations, and passenger and cargo capacities between Hong Kong and Taiwan.  Not only will the arrangement benefit the development of the aviation, freight and tourism industries of the two places, it will also strengthen Hong Kong’s position as an international and regional aviation hub.  Furthermore, the Hong Kong Economic, Trade and Cultural Office in Taiwan commenced operation last December.  This marks a significant step in fostering the co-operation between Hong Kong and Taiwan on economic, cultural and other fronts in the long run.97.Linkage to the world is one of the competitive edges of Hong Kong.  Since this Government took office, we have been strengthening trade ties with emerging markets.  I led various business delegations to the BRICS countries, South East Asia, South America, etc., and signed with a number of trading partners a series of tax arrangements, investment promotion and protection agreements and free trade agreements (FTAs).  Hong Kong has started negotiations with Chile on a bilateral FTA recently, which will enable us to tap business opportunities and development potential in this emerging market, and open a gateway to the South American region.98.We need to pursue participation in multilateral and regional economic co-operation to reinforce Hong Kong’s position as Asia’s world city. To this end, we have conveyed to ASEAN our wish to join the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area.  We shall also continue to be an active member of the World Trade Organization and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation to further promote trade and investment liberalisation.  With these efforts, more business opportunities will be opened up, facilitating greater trade and investment flows for Hong Kong.99.To enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong as an international financial, investment and commercial hub, we shall continue our efforts to expand our network of avoidance of double taxation agreements.  Significant progress has been made in recent years, and our endeavour has been widely recognised by both local and foreign chambers of commerce.  In just two years after the relevant legislative amendments took effect to align Hong Kong’s exchange of tax information arrangements with international standards, we have already signed 17 new agreements, including those with some major economic partners such as the UK, Japan and France.  We have also concluded agreements with partners like India, Malaysia and Mexico, and are in discussion with other partners, including Canada and South Korea.100.At present, there are 7 000 parent companies from overseas and the Mainland operating in Hong Kong, an increase of six per cent over 2010.  They are attracted by a combination of factors, including our strategic location, sound legal system, simple and low tax regime and diverse pool of talent.  We must strive to maintain these competitive edges.101.I believe that we should take full advantage of our relationship with the Mainland while enhancing our international outlook.  This should continue to be our way forward.  It will further reinforce Hong Kong’s position as a global economic, financial and commercial centre.  Hong Kong is prepared and ready for future challenges.']"
91,2012,Promoting Development of Industries,"['Promoting Development of Industries', '102.To maintain Hong Kong’s competitiveness, we have been pursuing economic development in recent years by actively promoting the four traditional pillar industries and the six industries where Hong Kong enjoys clear advantages..']"
92,2012,The Pillar Industries,"['The Pillar Industries', '103.The four pillar industries, namely trading and logistics, financial services, business and professional services, and tourism, have been the engines powering Hong Kong’s economic development for years.  In 2010, the four industries brought about a total value added of almost $1,000 billion and made a contribution of 58 per cent to GDP, which represented an increase of nearly 15 per cent over the previous year.  They employed nearly 1.7 million people in the year.']"
93,2012,Trading and Logistics,"['Trading and Logistics', '104.First, trading and logistics.  With Hong Kong’s strategic location and the competitive edge of the trading and logistics industry in handling high-value goods and providing high value-added services, Hong Kong is well-positioned to develop into a high-value goods inventory management and regional distribution centre.  To facilitate development in line with this trend, the Government put a second logistics site at Tsing Yi on the market last December for the construction of modern logistics facilities.  We shall continue to identify land suitable for logistics and port backup uses to meet the industry’s development needs.105.The planning of airport development and construction take time.  Therefore, we should formulate long-term strategies in a timely manner to ensure that the handling capacity of the Hong Kong International Airport will fully meet the ever-increasing air traffic demand.  Last year, the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AA) commenced Phase 1 works of its midfield expansion project to provide additional aircraft stands and apron facilities and a new passenger concourse.  Upon completion of the project, the handling capacity of the airport will be increased to 70 million passengers and six million tonnes of cargo a year.  Such capacity will be sufficient to cope with the air traffic demand up to 2020.106.The AA launched a public consultation in 2011 on the findings of the Hong Kong International Airport Master Plan 2030.  In their report submitted to the Government, the AA has recommended adopting the three-runway system as the blueprint for the airport’s future development and further planning.  The future development of the airport, the construction or not of the third runway in particular, and the overall economic development of Hong Kong are inextricably intertwined.  The project will have profound financial implications for our society.  The Government is considering the AA’s recommendations carefully in a bid to make an early decision for the commencement of the next stage of work, which includes conducting an environmental impact assessment and preparing the associated detailed design and financing proposals.107.Turning to the port, we have commissioned a preliminary feasibility study on the development of Container Terminal 10 at Southwest Tsing Yi to assess the project’s impact on the environment and on road and marine traffic.  We have also commenced the Study on the Strategic Development Plan for Hong Kong Port 2030 to update port cargo forecasts and explore how to make better use of the existing port facilities in support of future development.  Both studies are scheduled for completion by the end of this year.  We shall take into account the study results, economic situation, the views of stakeholders, etc. when deciding on the need to develop Container Terminal 10 and the timetable.108.While developing its services, the shipping industry is also very concerned about environmental protection.  Last year, it launched the Fair Winds Charter.  By signing the Charter, the industry voluntarily switches to low sulphur fuel for ocean-going vessels berthing in Hong Kong waters in a bid to reduce emissions.  To encourage more carriers to switch to cleaner fuels when berthing in Hong Kong waters, I propose to reduce by half the port facilities and light dues charged on ocean-going vessels using low sulphur fuel while at berth in Hong Kong.  The proposed scheme will span three years and cost the Government $260 million.109.In response to the positioning of Hong Kong as an international maritime centre as set out in the National 12th Five-Year Plan, we shall continue to reinforce the local maritime service cluster, strengthen manpower training, and join hands with the industry to promote both locally and abroad our maritime services in areas such as ship management, maritime arbitration and ship finance.']"
94,2012,Financial Services,"['Financial Services', '110.The second pillar industry is financial services.  The World Economic Forum ranked Hong Kong first in its Financial Development Index announced in late 2011.  Overtaking the US and the UK, Hong Kong becomes the first Asian financial centre to top the rankings.  We shall keep up our efforts in maintaining Hong Kong’s edge in financial services.111.Last year, Hong Kong further consolidated its position as an offshore renminbi (RMB) business centre.  Since last August, cross-border trade settlement in RMB has been expanded to cover the entire nation.  RMB trade settlement conducted through Hong Kong amounted to RMB 1,900 billion in 2011, which was five times the value of the whole year of 2010.112.Hong Kong became the first place outside the Mainland to develop an RMB bond market.  As at the end of last year, there were 116 RMB bond issuances with a total value approaching RMB 180 billion.  As at the end of 2011, RMB deposits in Hong Kong amounted to nearly RMB 590 billion, representing an increase of nearly 90 per cent compared with the RMB 310 billion as at the end of 2010.113.Last year, the Central Government announced a package of measures to support financial development in Hong Kong, of which eight are beneficial to the development of RMB business, such as allowing the use of RMB for direct investments in the Mainland and permitting investments in Mainland’s equity and bond markets through the RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (RQFII) Scheme.  These measures have been implemented.  Regarding the RQFII, the first batch of products was approved by the Securities and Futures Commission in December last year for public subscription.114.As regards strengthening our role as a fund-raising platform, Hong Kong was ranked first worldwide for the third consecutive year in terms of the total amount of funds raised through initial public offering, which amounted to US$33 billion in 2011.  Enterprises from the US, Switzerland, Kazakhstan and Italy came last year to list here for the first time.115.On asset management, Hong Kong’s combined fund management business set another record high of over HK$10 trillion by the end of 2010, representing a year-on-year growth of almost 19 per cent.  Two-thirds of the assets of the fund management business in Hong Kong were sourced from non-Hong Kong investors, indicating that Hong Kong was a preferred location for overseas fund managers to conduct asset management business.116.We shall continue to consolidate our position as a global platform to raise capital.  In collaboration with the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEx), we shall strive to attract more overseas companies, especially those from emerging markets, to list in Hong Kong.  While maintaining a high standard of regulation, the HKEx is also studying ways to further facilitate listing or secondary listing of overseas companies in Hong Kong, and accept companies incorporated in other jurisdictions to apply to list here.117.On the development of Islamic finance, we are close to finalising the draft amendments to the relevant legislation with a view to levelling the playing field for common types of Islamic bonds (i.e. sukuk) vis-à-vis their conventional counterparts as far as profits tax, property tax and stamp duty are concerned.  We plan to conduct market consultation in the first quarter of this year to gauge market views on our legislative proposals, and introduce the amendment bill into this Council in the next legislative session.118.With regard to the bond market, the iBond we launched last year was well received.  It has helped enhance retail investors’ understanding of and interest in bond investment, thereby fostering the development of the retail bond market in Hong Kong.  It has also provided investors with another option for coping with inflation.  As the interest rates in the market continue to stay at low levels, the attractiveness of conventional fixed-rate retail bonds to investors has been limited.  To further promote the sustainable development of the retail bond market, another issuance of the iBond is a preferable option in the short term.  I have to point out that this is a special measure taken at this time having regard to the current market situation.  In the long run, we need to leave room for developing other kinds of bonds, including conventional fixed-rate bonds, for the development of a more mature bond market in Hong Kong.119.We shall launch a further issuance of iBond worth not more than HK$10 billion under the Government Bond Programme.  The iBond, with a maturity of three years, will target Hong Kong residents.  Interest will be paid to bond holders once every six months at a rate linked to the inflation of the last half-year period.  The HKMA will announce relevant details as soon as possible.']"
95,2012,Business and Professional Services,"['Business and Professional Services', '120.The third pillar industry is business and professional services.  The National 12th Five-Year Plan emphasises domestic demand expansion, as well as upgrading and restructuring.  Vice-Premier Li Keqiang also stressed last August during his visit to Hong Kong that the Central Government supported the stable growth, upgrading and restructuring of Hong Kong enterprises engaging in processing trade in the Mainland.  The policy initiatives include maintaining a stable policy on processing trade, establishing a sound mechanism to facilitate the domestic sales of processing trade, and encouraging Hong Kong enterprises engaging in processing trade to upgrade and restructure.  To assist Hong Kong enterprises in capturing the opportunities arising from the National 12th Five-Year Plan in a more focused manner, the Chief Executive proposed in his Policy Address the setting up of a dedicated fund of $1 billion.  The fund aims to help Hong Kong enterprises tap the Mainland market by restructuring and upgrading their operations, developing their brands and expanding domestic sales in the Mainland.  We shall seek funding approval from this Council in the first half of this year.121.The National 12th Five-Year Plan proposes lifting the share of the value added of the service sector in the Mainland’s GDP by four percentage points in five years, equivalent to Hong Kong’s GDP in one year.  This will provide development opportunity of massive value for Hong Kong, being a service-oriented economy, and in particular service industry operators who wish to tap the Mainland market.122.In this regard, the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) provides a suitable platform for Hong Kong enterprises and professionals to gain preferential market access to the Mainland.  Under the framework of CEPA, the Government will maintain close liaison with the Mainland and the industries, and continue to encourage mutual recognition of professional qualifications and facilitate Hong Kong professionals’ practice and business start-ups in the Mainland, etc.  All these efforts will serve to help meet the target of basically achieving liberalisation of trade in services between the Mainland and Hong Kong towards the end of the National 12th Five-Year Plan period.123.Mainland enterprises can enhance their strength in tapping overseas markets by taking advantage of Hong Kong’s mature service industry and rich international business experiences.  Likewise, overseas companies can also invest in the Mainland market by making use of the business and professional services Hong Kong provides.  We shall continue to work closely with the Mainland and actively complement the accelerated implementation of the policy of encouraging Mainland enterprises to go global, bringing into full play Hong Kong’s strengths in various services sectors, including financial services, trading, legal services, accounting, logistics and advisory services.124.Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) will step up its efforts to go global jointly with both Mainland and Hong Kong enterprises.  Together they will search for merger and acquisition and investment opportunities overseas, providing a win-win situation for all.  To this end, the HKTDC plans to organise investment study tours and tours for co-operation on branding, and hold its “Lifestyle Expo” in various overseas cities.  In addition, Invest Hong Kong will strengthen its publicity and promotional efforts in a number of Mainland cities to brief more Mainland enterprises on Hong Kong’s business edge, and highlight the territory’s role as a platform for Mainland companies to grow their business internationally.']"
96,2012,Tourism,"['Tourism', '125.Fourth, tourism.  Tourism is an important pillar of our economy and employs a workforce of nearly 220 000.  In 2011, our tourism industry again put up a robust performance.  The number of visitors reached a new high of 42 million during the year, an increase of almost 50 per cent over 2007.  Total spending associated with inbound tourism also saw an increase of nearly 70 per cent over 2007, exceeding $250 billion.126.In recent years, Hong Kong has been investing heavily in tourism infrastructure.  The redevelopment of Ocean Park at a cost of $5.5 billion will be completed within this year.  The Ocean Park is working on a plan to construct an all-weather waterpark.  We shall give it our full support to bring this project to fruition.  On the development of hotels in Ocean Park, we shall put in place flexible arrangements, so that Ocean Park can revise the tender conditions for re-tendering the projects.  We hope that these projects will help enhance the attractiveness of Ocean Park, making it ready for another success after an increase of 22 per cent in attendance last year.127.Turning to Disneyland.  Its attendance was close to six million last year, with merchandise, food and beverage sales as well as hotel room occupancy registering impressive growth.  Its latest themed area “Toy Story Land” was newly opened at the end of 2011 with another two, “Grizzly Gulch” and “Mystic Point”, scheduled for completion in 2012 and 2013 respectively.  We hope that the new themed areas will take Disneyland’s performance in the coming year to new heights.  Another phase of expansion in the existing park site is under planning.  We shall carefully consider the proposals to be submitted to us.128.Meanwhile, the development of the Kai Tak new cruise terminal is making good progress, with the terminal building and the first berth expected to start operation in mid-2013.  We shall also update the hardware infrastructure of the border crossings to provide speedier and more convenient clearance services for tourists.129.To make Hong Kong a more attractive place, the Mega Events Fund was established in 2009 for a period of three years.  The Fund has sponsored a variety of events staged by many local non-profit-making organisations, such as the Hong Kong Dragon Boat Carnival and the Hong Kong Open Championship (golf tournament).  I propose to allocate $150 million to the Mega Events Fund and extend its operation for five years.  We have also invited the Mega Events Fund Assessment Committee to study ways of giving the Fund more flexibility to facilitate its effective operation.130.Currently, there are nearly 190 hotels in Hong Kong, supplying more than 62 000 rooms.  The Government has been making various efforts to increase the supply of hotel rooms.  Firstly, we have put “hotel only” sites on our Land Sale Programme.  Three out of five “hotel only” sites included in the Land Sale Programme for 2011-12 have been sold.  It is estimated that they will provide more than 1 500 hotel rooms.  Another site sold was also designated for mixed development comprising hotels.  In addition, as at the end of last year, five applications for redevelopment or wholesale conversion of industrial buildings into hotels were approved by the Lands Department.  It is estimated that more than 1 500 hotel rooms will be provided.  Three other applications are being processed.  We estimate that the total number of hotels will increase by nearly 50 to close to 240 in 2016, supplying over 71 000 rooms, an increase of 9 000 rooms.']"
97,2012,The Six Industries,"['The Six Industries', '131.Cultural and creative industries, medical services, education services, innovation and technology, environmental industries, and testing and certification services are the six industries where Hong Kong enjoys advantages for further advancement.  The private-sector part of these industries accounted for 8.4 per cent of GDP in 2010 and contributed over $140 billion value added to our economy, an increase of more than 15 per cent over the previous year.  The number of employees engaged in these industries was close to 410 000.  I shall now give an account of the recent major development of each of these industries.']"

I have earmarked $100 million to support the operation of the Hong Kong Design Centre (HKDC) for the coming three years, and to finance two anchor events, namely Business of Design Week and Hong Kong Design Centre Awards.  Besides, we shall allocate new resources for a new round of the “Design Incubation Programme” launched by the HKDC.  The programme offers management, marketing, financial, facility and other professional support services to design start-ups during their two-year incubation period.133.Designated as Hong Kong Design Year, 2012 will feature a number of large-scale design activities for the promotion of Hong Kong design.  We shall collaborate with the design sector, sponsor some of the signature events through the CreateSmart Initiative, and encourage the sector to showcase their excellence.']"

We are formulating the land disposal arrangements for these sites, and plan to tender out the two sites at Wong Chuk Hang and Tai Po in the first quarter of 2012.  To ensure that services offered by new hospitals meet the needs of the public, future private hospitals will be subject to relevant development parameters covering the scope of services such as the types of specialty.  The standard of services, such as the number of beds, hospital accreditation and pricing transparency, will also be specified.']"
100,2012,Education Services,"['Education Services', '136.Our efforts to establish Hong Kong as a regional education hub have started to bear fruit.  In recent years, our tertiary institutions have been recognised as leading institutions in various international rankings, and our business administration programmes are among the best in the world.  In the 2010/11 academic year, 18000 non-local students from more than 70 countries or regions came to Hong Kong for post-secondary studies.  Relaxing the restrictions on non-local students to stay in or return to Hong Kong will help attract more non-local students to come here to study.  Since the implementation of this initiative in May 2008, more than 15000 applications have been approved.  To further promote the internationalisation of our higher education, the Education Bureau will explore long-term goals and strategies in this respect and implement relevant measures to foster collaboration among institutions.137.We shall continue to facilitate the development of the international school sector to provide school places to meet the demand from families coming to Hong Kong for work or investment.  5000 additional international school places are expected to be available in the next few years with four international schools on greenfield sites coming on stream.  We will continue to support in-situ expansion of individual international schools or allocate suitable vacant school premises to them for short-term use.  We will carry on monitoring closely the provision of school places in the international school sector and maintaining dialogue with the schools as appropriate.138.On diversification, the number of self-financing degree-awarding tertiary institutions in Hong Kong has increased to six, providing a total of over 13000 places.  We launched two sites in 2010, and another two in 2011, for the development of self-financing degree programmes.  We shall consider launching more sites as appropriate having regard to the development of the sector.']"
101,2012,Innovation and Technology,"['Innovation and Technology', '139.In recent years, we have sought to create an environment that facilitates the development of innovation and technology.  We shall strengthen our efforts in four areas in the coming year.140.Firstly, for providing world-class research infrastructure, Hong Kong Science Park Phase 3 development, costing $4.9 billion, has commenced.  The expansion will increase the floor area of Hong Kong Science Park by 50 per cent to 330 000 square metres and create 4 000 scientific research-related jobs.  The first batch of new buildings is scheduled for completion in early 2014.141.The Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC) will continue to revitalise the three industrial estates.  We shall also invite the HKSTPC to explore the feasibility of expanding the Yuen Long Industrial Estate by about 16 hectares.  To meet the needs for long-term development of the high-tech industry, we shall continue to identify sites for the sustainable development of Hong Kong Science Park and industrial estates.142.Last year’s Budget highlighted the importance of data centres to Hong Kong.  The Policy Address announced that two hectares of land in Tseung Kwan O had been reserved for the development of data centres, and that consideration would be given to the use of industrial buildings for data centres.  To ensure early provision of land for more data centres to be set up in Hong Kong, we shall implement two time-limited measures in 2012-13.  First, we shall exempt the waiver fees for using certain floors of eligible industrial buildings as data centres.  In addition, where lease modification is required for the development of an industrial lot into a high-tier data centre, the Government will assess the premium based on the use of the site as a high-tier data centre.  We shall announce the implementation details in due course.143.Secondly, for promoting collaboration with the Mainland, we shall encourage more local research and development (R&D) institutions and research personnel to take part in national science and technology programmes, and nominate Hong Kong experts for the National Science and Technology Programmes Expert Database.  We shall also start a new round of application exercise for Partner State Key Laboratories.144.Thirdly, we launched the R&D Cash Rebate Scheme in April 2010 to provide financial assistance to applied R&D projects and encourage co-operation between enterprises and local R&D institutions.  By the end of last year, the Scheme had benefited nearly 270 enterprises.  To enhance the effectiveness of the Scheme, we propose a threefold increase in the level of cash rebate under the Scheme for enterprises’ qualified R&D projects, from 10 per cent to 30 per cent.145.To support the R&D activities of SMEs, we propose to enhance the Small Entrepreneur Research Assistance Programme (SERAP) under the Innovation and Technology Fund by increasing the funding ceiling for each project under the SERAP from $4 million to $6 million.  We shall also refine the operational details of the Programme and expand its scope of funding.146.Fourthly, to nurture a culture of innovation, the Internship Programme under the Innovation and Technology Fund encourages universities, enterprises and R&D centres to employ local university graduates to participate in R&D.  In the past three years, over 800 internships were provided under the Programme.  To inspire more young people to engage in R&D, we shall increase the monthly allowance for each intern by nearly 20 per cent.']"
102,2012,Environmental Industries,"['Environmental Industries', '147.The current Government has introduced a number of green policies and has spent over $30 billion on environment-friendly facilities and funded projects.  The impetus provided by these facilities and projects has helped promote the environmental industries by creating numerous opportunities for the environmental engineering sector, thereby driving the demand for related skills, talent and services.148.These facilities and projects include the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme currently underway and Sludge Treatment Facilities under construction.  We have planned other public works such as the construction of Integrated Waste Management Facilities and Organic Waste Treatment Facilities.  With our measures to promote waste reduction and recycling, the recycling industry in Hong Kong has been taking shape.  To help enhance recycling technologies, we have earmarked land in EcoPark for the construction of facilities to break down waste electrical and electronic equipment into recyclable materials.149.Our green policies benefit not only the industrial sector but also professional services.  The Buildings Energy Efficiency Ordinance enacted in 2010 specifies the energy efficiency design standards for four types of building services installations, and requires certain buildings to conduct energy audits.  With the full implementation of the new legislation in September 2012, there will be more business opportunities for related professional services.  In collaboration with the industry, the Government has been promoting green building standards and assessment, bringing new opportunities for the green building sector.150.We shall also capitalise on Hong Kong’s advantages to open up business opportunities in the Mainland for our environmental industries.  The Government will support the industry’s participation in such activities as environmental exhibitions and trade missions to help build local environmental brands, and facilitate collaboration with local and overseas enterprises.']"
103,2012,Testing and Certification Services,"['Testing and Certification Services', '151.We have been working closely with the Hong Kong Council for Testing and Certification (HKCTC) to vigorously implement a three-year development plan for the testing and certification industry with a view to enhancing the industry’s competitiveness.  We shall also step up the promotion of our testing and certification services outside Hong Kong.  In particular, our efforts are targeted at promoting testing and certification and developing new services in four selected trades, namely Chinese medicine, construction materials, food and jewellery.152.In the field of Chinese medicine, we are assisting laboratories in raising the testing standard of Chinese herbal medicine.  As for construction materials, we shall make greater efforts to publicise the merits of product certification to the construction industry, and promote the product certification schemes for construction materials introduced in recent years.  In respect of the food trade, we have been providing funding support for the industry to develop a new certification scheme on food hygiene management for meeting the operational needs of the local catering industry.  This will create business opportunities for certification services.  For the jewellery trade, we have worked out standard testing methods for jadeite jade, and shall introduce standard testing methods for the other two types of jade next year.  In addition, the HKCTC will set up two new panels this year to explore with the industry new business opportunities in environmental protection and information and communications technology sectors.153.With regard to access to the Mainland market, testing laboratories in Hong Kong have been allowed to perform testing of four types of products (i.e. toys, circuit installation, information technology equipment and lighting apparatus) processed in Hong Kong for the China Compulsory Certification (CCC) System since last year.  Under Supplement VIII to CEPA, the coverage of this pilot scheme will be extended this year to all 23 types of products under CCC.  This offers testing laboratories in Hong Kong new opportunities to undertake testing work in the Mainland.']"
104,2012,Conclusion,"['Conclusion', '154.The four pillar industries and the six industries are the major driving forces of our economy, accounting for over 60 per cent of GDP and employing a workforce of over 2 million.  The four pillar industries are well developed and have achieved significant growth over the years.  Flourishing in recent years, the six industries also have good potential for development.  Apart from creating many related jobs, these industries have also indirectly contributed to new employment opportunities in other sectors.  For example, the creation of every 100 jobs in financial services will in turn bring about some 60 jobs in related industries.  Similarly, in tourism and in import and export trade, every 100 jobs will indirectly bring about some 56 and 40 jobs respectively in related industries.  We shall keep working with relevant sectors to further enhance the competitiveness of these industries so that they will continue to contribute to our economic development.']"

With the impressive economic performance last year, the revenues from profits tax and salaries tax have increased by nearly $30 billion compared to the original estimate.  To counter the risk of asset-property bubbles, the Government increased land supply by putting additional sites on the market last year since the announcement of the Budget.  The sale of land brought in $83.1 billion, nearly $21.1 billion higher than the original estimate.  For government expenditure, I forecast that the revised estimate will be $366.4 billion, $11.8 billion less than the original estimate.157.For 2011-12, I forecast an operating surplus of $38.2 billion and a surplus of $66.7 billion in the Consolidated Account, equivalent to 3.5 per cent of GDP.

Recurrent expenditure will be $264.3 billion.  Capital expenditure will be $78.7 billion, including an all-time high of $62.3 billion on capital works.  Taking into account operating and capital expenditure, I forecast that government expenditure will reach $393.7 billion, an increase of seven per cent compared with the revised estimate for 2011-12.  Public expenditure will be equivalent to 21.4 per cent of GDP.159.I estimate that total government revenue for 2012-2013 will be $390.3 billion.  Earnings and profits tax, estimated at $161.6 billion, will still be our major source of revenue.  Land revenue is estimated at $60 billion.160.Taking all these into account, there will be a small deficit in our accounts in the coming years, and will largely achieve fiscal balance.  I forecast a deficit of $2.5 billion in the Operating Account and a deficit of $0.9 billion in the Capital Account.  There will be a deficit of $3.4 billion in the Consolidated Account.  Fiscal reserves are estimated at $658.7 billion by end-March 2013, representing approximately 34 per cent of GDP or equivalent to 20 months of government expenditure.

Recurrent expenditure is estimated to grow by 33 per cent during this period.162.The allocation of resources by the Government is based on the principle of ""policy leads and financial resources follow"".  A major function of the Budget is to provide funding for the implementation of the policy objectives and initiatives announced in the Policy Address.  I shall now give an account of government expenditure on education, health, social welfare, art, culture and sports, environmental protection and infrastructure.']"
109,2012,Education,"['Education', '163.Education is a matter of public concern.  For individuals, it is a pathway to knowledge; for parents, it is a road to success for their children about which they are most concerned.  Equipping our younger generation to achieve their full potential in a knowledge-based economy, education is also the golden key to promoting social mobility.164.Education is the policy area which has always taken up the largest share of recurrent government expenditure.  Recurrent expenditure in 2012-13 is nearly $60billion, a jump of 28 per cent compared with 2007-08.165.In the past few years, we have implemented a number of important education policies.  On pre-primary education, we launched the Pre-primary Education Voucher Scheme in the 2007/08 school year to provide direct subsidy for parents amid the diversified development in pre-primary education.  At present, over 80 per cent of kindergarten parents choose to enrol their children in schools participating in the Scheme.  In the 2010/11 school year, the Scheme benefited a total of 120000 school children with subsidies amounting to $2 billion.  We also provide school fee remission under the Kindergarten and Child Care Centre Fee Remission Scheme to ensure that children will not be deprived of the opportunity for kindergarten education due to lack of means.166.We notice that there are calls from the community for free pre-primary education.  We recognise the importance of pre-primary education and have allocated substantial resources to it.  The issue is not solely a question of resources.  More importantly, we must first analyse where the existing system is inadequate, and identify appropriate changes.  The Education Bureau will maintain dialogue with stakeholders and seek the views of different sectors to enhance the quality of pre-primary education.167.During the past few years, we have been increasing recurrent expenditure on primary and secondary education.  The Government extended free education to 12 years in 2008, incurring an additional annual expenditure of $1.2billion.  We have introduced small-class teaching in primary schools progressively since 2009.  More teaching staff and resources are required due to the increased number of classes, and the estimated additional expenditure will reach $2.1billion a year.  We also started to reduce in phases the number of students allocated to each Secondary 1 class from 38 to 34.  It is estimated that the additional expenditure involved will reach $1.4billion a year.  In 2009, we implemented the new senior secondary academic structure and enhanced the ratio of graduate teacher posts in public sector primary and secondary schools.  These measures are expected to involve an additional expenditure of $1.6 billion a year.168.With regard to post-secondary education, we estimate that, by the 2014/15 academic year, over one-third of the relevant age cohort will have the opportunity to pursue degree-level education.  If sub-degree places are also counted, over two-thirds of our young people in the relevant age group will have access to post-secondary education.  To facilitate the further development of post-secondary education, I have mentioned earlier that we shall provide $1 billion to implement a new Project Yi Jin, $2.5billion to launch the sixth Matching Grant Scheme and $2 billion to establish more scholarships.169.We shall also continue our two-pronged strategy to promote the parallel development of the publicly-funded sector and self-financing sector.  Apart from allocating $1 billion annually for increasing the number of first-year first-degree and senior year undergraduate places funded by the University Grants Committee, the Government also provides a series of support measures to promote the development of the self-financing post-secondary sector.  These measures include land grant at nominal premium, start-up loans, quality enhancement grants and accreditation grants.  Last November, we also set up the $2.5billion Self-financing Post-secondary Education Fund to offer scholarships to students and provide support to institutions to enhance the quality of education.170.Our established policy for student financial assistance is to ensure that no student will be denied access to education due to lack of means.  In the 2010/11 academic year, the Student Financial Assistance Agency (SFAA) disbursed grants and loans of over $4.6billion under various financial assistance and loan schemes, benefiting more than 360000 students or one-third of the total number of full-time students.171.To give greater support to students from low-income families, the Government introduced various measures in the 2011/12 academic year, including relaxing the income ceiling for full level of assistance under the means test mechanism, adjusting the tiers of assistance, increasing school textbook assistance, enhancing the Examination Fee Remission Scheme and the Kindergarten and Child Care Centre Fee Remission Scheme, etc.  The subsidy disbursed to each secondary or primary student who benefit from these measures will increase by 30 per cent to $5,000 a year on average, and the average grant per post-secondary student is also expected to increase by nearly 20 per cent to $38,000.  It is estimated that the amount of grants and loans disbursed by the SFAA in the 2011/12 academic year will increase by $800million to more than $5.4 billion.172.The Government commenced the Phase 2 public consultation on the Review of Non-means-tested Loan Schemes for post-secondary students in November last year.  Proposals put forward include measures seeking to ease the repayment burden of student loan borrowers.  If the proposals are supported by the public, the Government will implement them in phases starting from the next academic year.  The Education Bureau will also review the interest rate mechanism for the means-tested living expenses loans and launch improvement measures in the next academic year.']"
110,2012,Health,"['Health', '173.Next to education, health care is an area of great public concern.  In the past few years, the Government has provided additional resources to improve health care services.  The recurrent expenditure on health care will be almost $45 billion in 2012-13,                 an increase of over 40 per cent when compared with 2007-08.  The amount of recurrent funding allocated to the Hospital Authority will also increase by nearly 40 per cent to $40 billion in 2012-13.  In the coming year, $2.2 billion will be allocated to meet expenditure on hospital projects, and $500 million to acquire and upgrade medical equipment for public hospitals.174.We have been continuously upgrading public health care facilities and specialist services through the provision of additional resources.  In 2012-13, the Hospital Authority will increase its in-patient service capacity and strengthen its neonatal intensive care service.  It will provide haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis services for an additional 120 renal patients, provide risk factor assessment and management services for 84 000 diabetic and hypertensive patients, and set up eight new teams to take care of an additional 33 600 hypertensive patients.  Moreover, the Hospital Authority will extend the coverage of its community-based case management programme for patients with severe mental illness to four more districts, and enhance its care for hospitalised mental patients by providing multi-disciplinary treatment.  With additional resources, the Government is also taking forward health care service reform initiatives in a progressive manner.  These initiatives include enhancing primary care, encouraging public-private partnership, implementing hospital accreditation, and developing a territory-wide electronic health record sharing system.175.In the past five years, the number of full-time medical staff of the Hospital Authority increased by more than 10 per cent to 60 000 in 2011-12, including the addition of some 300 doctors and 1 800 nurses.  Looking ahead, we need to recruit yet more medical staff.  Apart from increasing the provisions for medical services, we shall allocate $200 million to increase the number of first-year first-degree places in medicine by 100, nursing by 40 and allied health professions by 146.176.At the same time, we shall take forward health care reform through three initiatives, i.e. reviewing the health care manpower strategy, facilitating health care service development, and formulating a regulatory framework and operational details for the Health Protection Scheme (HPS).  We expect to put forward specific proposals in the first half of 2013, and shall finalise the implementation arrangements and proceed with the necessary legislative process as soon as possible.  I have earmarked $50 billion for providing the funding and appropriate financial incentives needed to support the healthcare financing arrangements.']"
111,2012,Social Welfare,"['Social Welfare', '177.Recurrent government expenditure on social welfare for 2012-13 is estimated at $44billion, representing an increase of $10billion, or nearly 30 per cent, when compared with $34billion for 2007-08.178.To cope with an ageing population, the Government has allocated substantial resources to various elderly services in recent years.  In line with the Government’s elderly policy which regards ""ageing in place as the core, institutional care as back-up"", we have allocated funds to provide 2000 additional places of community care services, including 1500 places for the Enhanced Home and Community Care Services and 500 day care places, from 2007-08 to 2011-12.  For the coming year, I propose to increase recurrent funding by $36million for the provision of an additional 500 places for the Enhanced Home and Community Care Services and some 180 day care places.  There will also be a breakthrough in the current funding and operation model for subsidised services as Government plans for a pilot scheme on community care service voucher for the elderly.  Under the scheme, subsidy will be provided directly to eligible elders for them to choose the services they need.179.While encouraging ""ageing in place"", the Government will continue to devote additional resources to upgrading residential care services and providing more residential care places.  In the past five years, we have allocated funds to provide 3600 additional subsidised residential care places.  From 2011-12 to 2014-15, more than 2600 additional subsidised residential care places will come on stream.180.Last year’s Policy Address announced the provision of public transport concessions for the elderly and eligible people with disabilities to travel on the general MTR lines, franchised buses and ferries at a concessionary fare of $2 a trip.  The Government is discussing the details of and specific arrangements for the concession scheme with the public transport operators concerned and the Octopus Cards Limited, with a view to launching the concession scheme in 2012-13.181.Apart from providing funding for elderly services, we have also devoted substantial resources to supporting other people in need.  We have strengthened rehabilitation services and support services to children, youngsters and families.  On rehabilitation services, we have enacted the Residential Care Homes (Persons with Disabilities) Ordinance to bring the licensing scheme for residential care homes for persons with disabilities (RCHDs) into operation.  We have also introduced certain complementary measures, which include providing $70million for the implementation of a pilot Bought Place Scheme for private RCHDs and $39 million for the Financial Assistance Scheme.  The aim is to encourage private RCHDs to upgrade their service standards and provide them with subsidies for improvement works.182.In 2010, we allocated $135million as well to set up Integrated Community Centres for Mental Wellness across the territory for the provision of district-based and one-stop services.  Additional funding totalling $48million for 2011-12 and the coming year has been made available to strengthen the manpower of these centres to dovetail with the Case Management Programme of the Hospital Authority and provide services for more people in need.183.On support services to children and families, we shall provide 130 additional places for residential child care services in phases and raise the foster care allowance for foster families.  In addition to the Integrated Family Service Centre established in Sham Shui Po last year, another three centres will be set up in districts with greater service demand, bringing the total number of such centres to 65.  The total annual expenditure of these measures is estimated to be about $68million.184.On youth services, to reach out to more youths at risk, we shall set up three more youth outreaching teams, one each in Tseung Kwan O, Ma On Shan and Tung Chung.  With the additional teams, we can counsel them and refer them to other mainstream services.  This will incur additional annual funding estimated at $12million.']"
112,2012,"Art, Culture and Sports","['Art, Culture and Sports', '185.The Government will continue to allocate substantial resources to the development of art, culture and sports.  We granted a one-off upfront endowment of $21.6billion in 2008 to the West Kowloon Cultural District (WKCD) Authority for the implementation of the WKCD project.  We also injected $3 billion into the Arts and Sport Development Fund in 2010 and received approval to set up a  $7billion ""Elite Athletes Development Fund"" in 2011 in support of the long-term development of sports, art and culture.186.The Government’s expenditure on art and culture in  2012-13 will exceed $3billion.  In 2012-13, we shall provide a total of $40million additional funds for nine major performing arts groups, bringing the total amount of funding to over $300million, an increase of almost 40 per cent compared with 2007-08.  Efforts have also been made to upgrade and promote museum service and organise major exhibitions for audience building.  Expenditure on museum exhibitions and public art in 2012-13 will be about $85million.187.Since 2007, four new libraries have come into service.  In 2009, the Government extended and standardised the opening days of major and district libraries in the territory to seven days a week, with weekly opening hours of 71 hours.  The annual recurrent expenditure on library services has increased by $34million since then.188.On sports development, we are promoting ""sport for all"" in the community.  Since 2007-08, a total of more than $600million has been spent on organising recreational and sports activities in the community.  Through the School Sports Programme, we also encourage students of primary, secondary and special schools to participate regularly in sports activities.  In 2012-13, we shall raise our funding support for national sports associations to almost $250million for providing training to athletes and organising sports events.  Through the ""M"" Mark Scheme, we help national sports associations host major international sports events in Hong Kong.189.On sports infrastructure, we are building our first indoor velodrome in Tseung KwanO while redeveloping both the Victoria Park and the Kwun Tong Swimming Pools.  Preparatory work is underway for the development of a sports complex at Kai Tak.  This project involves the construction of a main stadium, a secondary stadium and an indoor sports arena.  We are conducting a consultancy study on the project to explore the most suitable construction and financing arrangements.']"
113,2012,Environmental Protection,"['Environmental Protection', '190.We are committed to protecting the environment, making Hong Kong a green and more pleasant place to live.  The current-term Government has allocated over $30billion for building environment-friendly facilities, funding green projects, improving air quality, combating climate change, and improving waste management.  To improve roadside air quality and promote green transport, we provide grants and tax concessions to encourage early replacement of old diesel commercial vehicles with new ones, and purchase of more environment-friendly vehicles.  In addition, we have allocated $300million for setting up a Pilot Green Transport Fund to facilitate trial use of green and innovative transport technologies in the transport industry.  Trials approved include the testing of electric vehicles for various uses, such as electric non-franchised buses for resident shuttle services and employee and on-campus transportation, and electric goods vehicles for courier services and goods transportation.  These trial runs will commence within this year.  The Government has also taken an important step to start the use of zero-emission buses, and we shall seek this Council’s approval for a provision of $180 million to subsidise trials of hybrid buses and fully electric buses by the franchised bus companies.  The ultimate policy objective is the full-scale use of zero-emission buses across the territory.191.On the promotion of electric vehicles, currently there are over 240 electric vehicles on local roads, more than double that of last year.  We are installing charging facilities for electric vehicles in government car parks as planned.  Along with the related facilities provided by the business and non-government sectors, it is estimated that there will be about 1000 charging points in Hong Kong by mid-2012.192.To combat climate change, save energy and reduce emissions, we have implemented new measures and introduced new legislation.  The Mandatory Energy Efficiency Labelling Scheme, launched in 2009, now covers products whose electricity consumption accounts for 70 per cent of that in the residential sector.  The  current-term Government has injected a total of $1.5 billion into the Environment and Conservation Fund.  It subsidises projects which promote energy saving, waste reduction and recycling, greening, conservation and scientific research on environmental protection.  These projects aim at encouraging people’s participation in the promotion of a greener lifestyle at different levels.  Between 2008 and the end of 2011, the Fund approved more than 2000 projects involving subsidies of over $1 billion.193.On improving waste management, the overall recovery rate of municipal solid waste in Hong Kong rose from 45 per cent in 2006 to 52 per cent in 2010.  Under the legal framework provided by the Product Eco-responsibility Ordinance enacted by the Legislative Council in 2008, we have been progressively implementing a mandatory Producer Responsibility Scheme.  With the Environmental Levy Scheme on Plastic Shopping Bags put in place since 2009, the number of such bags distributed by 3000 registered retail outlets covered by the Scheme has dropped by as much as 90 per cent.  Preparatory work is underway for the extension of the Environmental Levy Scheme on Plastic Shopping Bags and the introduction of a Producer Responsibility Scheme for waste electrical and electronic equipment.  We are also consulting the public on the proposal for charging municipal solid waste.']"
114,2012,Infrastructure,"['Infrastructure', '194.To fulfil our policy objective of promoting economic growth through infrastructural development, the current-term Government has been increasing its investment in capital works over the past few years.  By making such investment we can lay a firm foundation for future economic development and create employment opportunities during the project construction period.  The total value of projects approved by this Council is expected to increase by three times from $62 billion in 2007-08 to $184 billion this year.  The annual actual expenditure on capital works also sees a significant threefold increase from $20.5billion in 2007-08 to $62.3billion in 2012-13 and is expected to increase to over $70billion per year in the next few years.195.Expenditure on capital works is our investment in the future.  A large part of the expenditure is devoted to massive projects, such as the Ten Major Infrastructure Projects, cross-boundary facilities, and transport infrastructural projects, with a view to expanding our economic hinterland and strengthening the territory’s road and railway network.  These projects include the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, the Liantang/Heung Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point, the Central-Wan Chai Bypass, and railway construction works of the South Island Line (East) and the West Island Line.  We shall also seek funding approval for the construction of the Shatin to Central Link from this Council in the current legislative session.196.To increase land supply, we shall continue to carry out infrastructure works such as land formation, road construction and laying of water mains in the new development areas of different districts such as Tseung Kwan O, Kai Tak, Tuen Mun and Yuen Long.197.While implementing large-scale infrastructure projects, we have spared no effort in taking forward projects of various scales to meet people’s demand for public facilities for everyday life.  District works projects approved by this Council in the five legislative sessions from 2007-08 are estimated at $220 billion in total.  These projects include schools, hospitals, libraries, sports centres, swimming pools and community halls.  We also hope to provide our citizens a better living environment and quality leisure facilities through implementing projects such as parks, cycle tracks and greening works.  Upon completion of all the on-going and approved waterfront promenade projects at Central, Quarry Bay, Kwun Tong and Kai Tak, the length of the water promenade open for public use will be extended by two kilometres.198.Besides taking forward individual projects to construct waterfront promenades, the Development Bureau is exploring with the Harbourfront Commission on the establishment of a statutory and dedicated harbourfront authority, which will push ahead with the design, construction, operation and management of harbourfront projects with a creative mindset, flexible framework and entrepreneurial culture.  A proposal is expected to be put forward in the middle of this year.  We aspire to create a vibrant waterfront with all kinds of attractions for the enjoyment of the public and tourists.  If the proposal is widely supported by the community, we shall provide the necessary financial support.']"
115,2012,Public Finance Management,"['Public Finance Management', '199.Our need to achieve fiscal balance and avoid deficits is enshrined in the Basic Law.  I have kept this in mind when preparing this Budget, just as I have in the past four years.  While maintaining a low tax environment, we spare no effort to provide quality services for our people.  We also ensure adequate fiscal reserves to cope with economic contingencies and build a solid financial foundation for the future.']"
116,2012,Revenue,"['Revenue', '200.Our revenue comes mainly from five sources, namely profits tax, land premium, salaries tax, stamp duty and investment returns on fiscal reserves.  Together they account for three quarters of our total revenue.  Highly susceptible to economic fluctuations, they are affected by the ebb and flow of the economy.  Revenue from these sources has fluctuated wildly over the past decade, bringing many challenges to the management of public finances.201.During the budget consultation period, some people suggested tax deductions for business or personal spending in particular areas such as rent, children’s education, medical services, insurance and the purchase of products with Grade 1 Energy Efficiency Labels.202.I fully understand that these suggestions are meant to reduce the burden of taxpayers or operating costs of businesses.  However, I would like to point out that our simple and low tax regime has stood Hong Kong in good stead and contributed to our success over many years.  Various types of allowances and deductions which are very generous are already provided under the current tax system.  We must be extremely cautious when considering tax deduction proposals of any kind.203.As far as profits tax is concerned, all operating expenses and capital expenditure permitted by the law are deductible from taxable profits.  Currently, nearly 90 per cent of companies do not have to pay tax.  Some have suggested that we should introduce ""group loss relief"" and ""loss carry-back"" arrangements and tax concessions for specific sectors or enterprises.  When considering these suggestions, we need to take into account various factors, such as whether the proposals will further narrow our tax base and restrict the source of tax revenue to a handful of enterprises, making our tax revenue unstable.204.In view of this year’s economic forecast, and in support of our enterprises, I have put forward proposals, such as offering a one-off reduction of profits tax, waiving the business registration fees, halving the charges for import and export declarations and abolishing capital duty levied on local companies.  These measures will benefit enterprises of different sizes in Hong Kong without compromising our established tax neutrality principle or being in favour of a particular type of enterprises.205.Turning to salaries tax, the personal allowances currently available to taxpayers, including basic allowance, dependent parent allowance and child allowance, are provided having regard to their basic needs and additional financial burden arising from family responsibilities.  The introduction of deductible items for various expenses of a private nature will make our tax system less flexible because individual taxpayers without the need to pay such specific expenses will not benefit from these deductions.206.That said, I fully understand the financial burden of the middle class in areas like housing, education, and health care.  In view of this year’s economic situation and the needs of taxpayers, I have proposed one-off salaries tax reduction and adjustments to various personal allowances or deductions, including basic allowance, single parent allowance, married person’s allowance, dependent parent allowance, child allowance, dependent brother/sister allowance, disabled dependant allowance, and the extension of the entitlement period for the tax deduction for home loan interest.207.We have been striving to maintain a simple and low tax regime. According to the survey results of Invest Hong Kong and the Census and Statistics Department, our simple and low tax regime is the key favourable factor for Hong Kong as a location for setting up regional headquarters, regional offices or local offices.  Paying Taxes 2012-The Global Picture published by the World Bank at the end of last year pointed out that Hong Kong was ranked among the top in the world for the ease of paying taxes.  Among the advanced economies, Hong Kong is also one of the places with the lowest total tax rate.  These suggest that the tax system in Hong Kong is a positive factor underpinning the competitiveness of Hong Kong enterprises.']"
117,2012,Expenditure,"['Expenditure', '208.Government revenue is susceptible to fluctuations in the external economic environment, but it is undesirable to make any drastic changes to expenditure during periods of adversity.  That is because almost 60 per cent of our recurrent expenditure is provided for education, health and social welfare, which are closely related to people’s livelihood.  Reducing expenditure during an economic downturn will only add hardship to our people.  Instead, we shall increase government expenditure, and our adequate fiscal reserves can provide the headroom for financial manoeuvres under such circumstances.  In times of reduced revenue resulting from an economic downturn, the fiscal reserves allow us to maintain all the necessary public services, and adopt counter-cyclical fiscal measures to alleviate people’s burdens, stimulate the economy and invest in the future.  Take 2009 as an example.  When GDP was forecast to contract by two to three per cent that year, we adopted counter-cyclical measures.  We increased government expenditure and relieved the pressure on our people.  The strategy also created conditions favourable for the subsequent economic recovery.209.During the consultation period, there were quite a number of views on the appropriate level of public expenditure as a proportion of GDP.  The share of public expenditure is close to 20 per cent of GDP in recent years.  Our policy is to prevent overspending by the Government, which will stifle the development of the private market.  We strive to strike a proper balance between increasing government expenditure and maintaining a low tax regime.  In the event that our expenditure continuously exceeds this level, we shall need to explore ways of increasing our revenue to maintain a higher level of expenditure.  The European and the US governments have to resort to fiscal austerity measures of all kinds to tackle the debt crisis caused by their escalating expenditures in recent years.  This illustrates the importance of upholding fiscal principles and maintaining the health of our public finances.210.However, I must state that we can go beyond this level on a need basis.  In fact, in four of the past ten years, public expenditure exceeded 20 per cent of GDP.  This is also the case for the estimated public expenditure for 2012-13.211.In figuring out the level of government expenditure, we must take into account the fact that our Government adopts a cash-based accounting system with no provision for our liabilities, contingent liabilities and commitments, including the government bonds issued in 2004, the loan guarantees for SMEs, infrastructure commitment and civil service pension.  As at the end of March 2011, the present value of public officers pension obligations was over $530 billion.  Further increase is expected in the coming years.  As for infrastructure, the value of capital projects approved by the Finance Committee and to be submitted to this Council within the year has reached $400billion.  The loan guarantees for SMEs have surpassed $70billion.  If government revenue drops due to any economic downturn, we shall have to draw on our fiscal reserves to pay for these expenditure.212.Structural changes in the community such as an ageing population will also bring pressure to bear on public finances.  We estimate that our population aged 65 or above will increase from the current 0.9million to 2.1million in 2030.  To cope with this long-term issue, both the community and the Government will have to make sustained efforts in various respects.  Measures implemented in certain policy areas, such as the healthcare financing reform, will help us get ready for the future.  We also need to maintain adequate fiscal reserves if we are to take on the challenges posed by an ageing society.']"
118,2012,Medium Range Forecast,"['Medium Range Forecast', '213.For the medium term, I project that the annual average growth rate will be four per cent in real terms for the period 2013-16, while the underlying inflation rate will average 3.5percent.  I forecast a small deficit in the Operating Account, Capital Account and Consolidated Account for 2012-13.  The Operating Account will see a surplus for the period between 2013-14 and 2016-17.  With expenditure on infrastructure projects ever increasing, a deficit will arise in the Capital Account for the whole period.  As we have earmarked $50billion for 2015-16 to support the healthcare financing arrangements, the Consolidated Account will also run a deficit in that year.  Fiscal reserves are estimated at $670.4billion by end-March 2017, representing about 27percent of GDP or 18 months of government expenditure.']"
119,2012,Concluding Remarks,"['Concluding Remarks', '214.Mr President, the office of Financial Secretary represents the most demanding responsibility that I have taken up during my years in the public service.  It is my great honour to have had the opportunity to take on these challenges and difficulties with the people of Hong Kong.215.I shall never forget the days when we were working together to fight against the financial turmoil.  Beset with an unprecedented crisis, our financial stability was shaken, local exports fell by the biggest margin ever.  This led to rising unemployment and negative GDP growth, affecting SMEs and the livelihood of our people.  But, the people of Hong Kong rose to the difficulties with perseverance and flexibility.  We not only rode out the crisis, we also staged a swift rebound well in advance of other economies.  Thanks to the solidarity and commitment of all our people, our financial system remained stable while GDP has returned to positive growth.  With full employment, Hong Kong saw a more vibrant retail business and market growth.216.While adhering to the principles of prudent management of public finances, we show our commitment to the community.  For my five budgets, I have increased government expenditure by nearly 70 per cent.  This exceeds GDP growth of 21 per cent for the same period.  Dedicated to education, medical services and social welfare to cater for public needs in such areas, this spending also helps invest in the future and sustain economic vibrancy.  The increase in expenditure demonstrates our commitment, and confidence in Hong Kong.  But we always bear in mind the importance of ensuring the structural integrity of public finances and keeping adequate fiscal reserves for future challenges.  This will also save our next generation from bearing a heavy burden.  In this year’s Budget, I have made proposals to build on the sound economic conditions facing us to brace ourselves for a possible downturn.  Although this term of Government will end in the middle of this year, we shall never give anything but our very best.  Where necessary, we shall take appropriate and timely measures in a responsible manner to safeguard the well being of our society and economy.217.A number of advanced economies around the world are currently engulfed by debt crises.  The crux of their difficulties lies in lax fiscal discipline that makes it hard to rectify the situation.  These governments have no alternative but to slash their expenditure or drastically increase their revenue, resulting in problems of all kinds in the political economy and society.  These are real examples of how much trouble overspending and excessive borrowing can cause.  They have convinced me that fiscal prudence is crucial if we are to maintain our socio-economic stability.  It is sensible to uphold the principle of sustainability in public finance management.  It is a principle that should not be abandoned lightly.218.Looking ahead, global economic crises will take a different course in terms of frequency, speed of contagion and intensity under the impact of globalisation.  As Hong Kong continues to grow, being an open and small economy, it is inevitably vulnerable to any fluctuation in the world economy.  In the face of social and economic changes in the days to come, we must uphold the principle of prudent management of public finances and strive to take pragmatic relief measures.  This will involve greater wisdom and courage.219.Trust and co-operation are keys to the functioning of a modern economy.  With trust and co-operation come reduced transaction costs, increased opportunities for economic development and social advance.  Without them, crises and shocks may easily make us stumble.  That is why we always want the ""big society"" to play its part in fostering opportunity for community co-operation and solving social problems by engaging public resources to support community efforts.220.This Government puts people first.  We introduced an array of measures to stabilise the economy and safeguard people’s livelihood during the past five years.  We attach importance to preserving employment not just for the sake of socio-economic stability, but because we take our people as our primary concern.  Similarly, when we invest in the future, we do not focus solely on hard infrastructure.  We place particular emphasis on the provision of education opportunities for individuals and promote the well-being of the community.  We make every effort to ease the hardship of those living in poverty.  No matter how difficult the economic environment is, we never give up our commitment to do so.221.Since I became Financial Secretary five years ago, I have always worked conscientiously.  As the saying goes, ""A steady conscience can stand the brunt of life.""  We have weathered tough times together, and overcome challenges and, each time, we have scaled new heights in our economic development.  We may not always see eye-to-eye with each other on how to deal with the difficulties we face, but working together we have always been able to find ways to develop Hong Kong into a better place.  Behind the intense discussions are our shared beliefs and affection for the place we live in, our home, Hong Kong.  We have survived all the crises and made Hong Kong a modern international city which we can all be proud of.  We are also able to show to the world our tenacity in the face of global competition.222.Mr President, we are fortunate to live and work in Hong Kong.  True, this extraordinary city is not immune to challenges, but it also brings out the best in us by providing inspiring opportunities.  From every crisis, without exception, we have emerged stronger and stood taller before the world.  Undoubtedly, there will be many more ups and downs on the road ahead.  But, if we take our shared beliefs as our guide and seek unity in our cause and trust in each other, there is nothing to stop us reaching many more milestones.  This is not only my sincere wish, but my unshakeable conviction.']"
120,2017,Introduction,"['Mr President, HonourableMembers and fellow citizens,', 'I move that the Appropriation Bill 2017 be read a second time.', 'Introduction', ""2.When I took over as the Financial Secretary on 16 January this year, the foremost task before me was to prepare the Budget for the coming financial year. I kept asking myself - What does Hong Kong need most now? What are citizens' expectations of the Government? What is our ideal way of life? How can we attain a sense of well-being? How do we position Hong Kong as an international city?"", '3.I came from a poor family and grew up in the 1960s and 1970s when people in Hong Kong were, in general, happy and satisfied with their lives as long as they had a shelter and got enough to eat and wear. Hong Kong then saw brisk economic growth in the 1980s and 1990s and after that, two financial crises. I believe that having gone through these changes, Hong Kong people now crave for more than the basic necessities. We all want further progress in society, so that young people can cherish hopes for the future, the middle-aged need not worry about the competitiveness of the younger generation, and the elderly will have no fear of abandonment.', '4.It is not beyond our capacity to realise this vision for Hong Kong, but I dare not boast that we can open up a new world for Hong Kong by one Budget alone. My endeavour is to make use of the wealth we have accumulated together through hard work to take care of the needy in the society, ease the heavy burden of middle-class families, and make appropriate investments essential for building a better Hong Kong.', '5.I understand that people from all walks of life have different expectations of the Budget and hope the Government can respond to their demands. However, the reality is that resources are not unlimited, and that no Budget can ever meet the needs of each and every member of the community and win applause from all. We can only devote our best efforts to provide support for those in need, share wealth with the community when there is a substantial surplus and allocate resources to areas which are conducive to our social and economic development.', '6.In the coming year, our economy will be fraught with uncertainties arising from the complicated and volatile external environment. I hope that with wisdom, collaboration and relentless efforts, we will have the strength to rise to all challenges ahead and embrace the future with hope.']"
121,2017,Economic Performance in 2016,"['Economic Performance in 2016', ""7.The global economy operated in low gear in 2016 and recorded the slowest growth since the global financial crisis. The situation was particularly grim at the beginning of the year, affecting the trade performance of Hong Kong and the Asian region. The subsequent abatement of downward pressures on the external front led to a rebound in Hong Kong's exports of goods, registering a year-on-year growth of 1.7 per cent in real terms for 2016 as a whole. Exports of services, though showing some relative improvement during the year and picking up in the fourth quarter, still fell by 3.1 per cent for the whole year. With the gradual recovery of tourism, the decline in the overall retail sales volume slowed notably to only 3.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, but for the whole year it was still down by 7.1 per cent."", '8.Domestic demand strengthened in the latter half of last year. Favourable employment and earnings conditions, together with the support of relief measures introduced in the last Budget, were conducive to sanguine consumer sentiment. The growth of private consumption expenditure gathered pace in the second half of last year, and investment expenditure also bounced back visibly.', ""9.Overall, the local economy picked up progressively from a marginal growth rate of one per cent in the first quarter to 3.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. For 2016 as a whole, there was a modest growth of 1.9 per cent, generally in line with the one to two per cent economic growth as forecast in last year's Budget."", ""10.The unemployment rate averaged 3.4 per cent last year, sustaining a state of full employment in general. Inflation pressure was moderate. The headline inflation rate for 2016 was 2.4 per cent. Netting out the effects of the Government's one-off measures, the underlying inflation rate was 2.3 per cent in 2016, the fifth consecutive year of easing.""]"
122,2017,Economic Outlook for 2017,"['Economic Outlook for 2017', '11.Looking ahead, in 2017, the economic growth of advanced economies will be modest and patchy. This, coupled with new uncertainties brought about by political changes in many parts of the world and rising populist and protectionist sentiments, will further complicate the situation and render the global economic outlook volatile.', '12.The US economy has continued to improve in the recent period but the economic policy agenda of the new administration has remained unclear. Despite the fact that the US may introduce fiscal stimulus measures conducive to global economic growth, there is increasing market concern over whether the US will roll out, in phases, a number of trade protection measures, which may disrupt the improving growth momentum in global trade. The Federal Reserve Board (Fed) will proceed with or even expedite the normalisation of US interest rates. Consequently, monetary policy divergence among major central banks will become more pronounced. All these will impact on the global economy and financial environment.', '13.Economic growth in Europe is still constrained by its structural debts. This, together with the Brexit developments and the upcoming general elections in some major European countries this year, will complicate and add uncertainties to the political and economic outlook for Europe. This may weigh on the European economy as well as global monetary and financial stability.', '14.The growth of the Mainland economy is increasingly driven by domestic demand and the service sector, and is moving towards a pattern of sustainable development. With stable and appreciable economic growth as well as ample policy room, the Mainland economy should be able to maintain a medium-high pace of growth, remaining a mainstay supporting global economic growth.', ""15.Japan's economy has been stuck in low gear, facing high deflation risks. A package of fiscal stimulus and monetary initiatives has been launched but the effectiveness is yet to be seen."", '16.As regards emerging markets, international energy and metal prices have rebounded from the low level over the recent past, easing the downward pressure on commodity-exporting economies. Emerging markets in Asia will remain the main propellers of global economic growth.', ""17.The slightly improved global economy over the recent period will lend support to Hong Kong's export performance. If the recent growth momentum continues, our merchandise exports will see a stronger performance this year. However, the aforesaid risk factors in the external environment will cast shadows over the export trade in Asia and in Hong Kong. Under these circumstances, sustaining domestic demand will remain crucial to maintaining the stable development of our economy and underpinning the employment market. Moreover, inbound tourism has improved recently, with fresh growth in the number of visitors. If this continues, the retail sector should be set to stabilise further."", '18.Locally, favourable conditions in the job market and rising labour earnings have bolstered consumer confidence in the recent past. Sustained increases in infrastructure and other building and construction activities should provide momentum for domestic demand. In the light of the recent developments and granting no severe external shocks, I forecast Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of two to three per cent in 2017.', '19.But, the uncertain external environment and interest rate trend may trigger abrupt shifts in capital flows and heighten volatility in local asset prices, with repercussions on consumption and investment sentiments and on macro-economic stability. Over the past few years, the tight supply of residential flats, ultra-low interest rates and an influx of capital have made the local property market even more exuberant, resulting in high flat prices which are out of tune with the local economy.', ""20.The current-term Government is committed to increasing land and housing supply, and has introduced several rounds of demand-side management measures and macro-prudential policies. These efforts have effectively maintained the overall macro-economic and financial stability. The introduction of the Special Stamp Duty and Buyer's Stamp Duty, together with the earlier increase in Ad Valorem Stamp Duty, has achieved significant results in combating short-term speculation, curbing external demand and reducing investment demand. Moreover, with the Government's strenuous efforts in increasing land supply in the past few years and the gradual completion of housing units, we expect that the supply of residential flats will increase substantially in the next few years. However, the property market may have to face potential risks if the Fed normalises interest rates faster this year. We will closely monitor the situation."", '21.The still-low global inflation and strong US dollar have lessened the impact of the rise in international oil prices, maintaining imported inflation at a low level. Inflationary pressure will remain mild in the short term. I forecast that the headline inflation rate for 2017 as a whole will be 1.8 per cent with an underlying inflation rate at two per cent.']"

Our GDP per capita has now reached US$44,000, overtaking Japan and many advanced economies in Europe.

Our achievements are also attributable to the unique advantage of ""one country, two systems"", the fair and corruption-free system, rule of law, and the open and efficient market that we have. I believe that while recognising the effect of market forces, the Government should play an active role as a facilitator by taking forward appropriate policies with the optimal use of public resources.

First, a higher monthly allowance of $3,435 will be provided for eligible elderly persons with more financial needs. Second, the existing asset limits will be relaxed to benefit more elderly persons. It is estimated that about 500 000 elderly persons, each receiving approximately $10,000 to $30,000 more a year, will benefit from these measures in the first year upon full implementation, and the coverage of OALA will increase from 37 per cent to 47 per cent of the elderly population, thus further strengthening retirement protection through the social security pillar. The Government will lower the eligibility age for Elderly Health Care Vouchers from 70 to 65, so that about 400 000 more elderly persons will receive $2,000 a year to purchase primary care services from the private sector. These measures represent a significant and long-term commitment, involving an additional recurrent government expenditure of about $9 billion per year on average over the next ten years."", '34.The Government is discussing with major stakeholders the proposal to progressively abolish the ""offsetting"" of severance payments or long service payments with Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) contributions. I will provide the necessary financial support having regard to the outcome.', '35.Besides, I will continue to allocate resources to optimise healthcare and elderly services, and enhance care and support for persons with disabilities.']"
127,2017,A Sound and Progressive Fiscal Policy,"['A Sound and Progressive Fiscal Policy', ""36.Mr President, in preparing this Budget, I have carefully considered the views of different sectors and note some gaps in the understanding of the Government's fiscal position. Please allow me an opportunity to offer some clarifications and suggest policy approaches, taking into account the three objectives of public finance, the macro-economic outlook and the Government's financial position."", 'Annual Surplus', ""37.Some sectors have suggested that since we are running a substantial fiscal surplus this year, the Government should reduce taxes and introduce more recurrent measures to alleviate people's financial burden."", ""38.As we all know, Hong Kong has a narrow tax base, and our revenue sources are concentrated. Profits tax, salaries tax, stamp duties, rates and land revenue account for about 75 per cent of total government revenue in 2015-16. Nevertheless, as a small and open economy, Hong Kong is particularly susceptible to global economic fluctuations, which is beyond the Government's control. Should there be any abrupt deterioration or fluctuation in the external economic environment, government revenue would be directly affected, and the consequences could be unpredictable. Analysis based on statistics over the past 25 years shows that although government revenue has grown broadly in line with the GDP, the former is often far more volatile than the latter. This has brought challenges to our public finances. Take this year as an example. The vast majority of the Government's surplus comes from the far higher-than-expected land revenue and stamp duties on properties. Our property market has experienced a market boom of nearly eight years. Property prices are still at a record high though trading in the market has turned quieter. Supply of private residential flats in the future is expected to gradually pick up to an average of nearly 20 000 units a year. It is difficult to tell whether revenue from land sales in the future will continue to hit successive new highs. In fact, over the past decade, land revenue varied considerably from a low level of less than $17 billion in 2008-09 to over $117 billion in 2016-17."", '39.Government revenue may fluctuate with the ups and downs of the economic cycle. Government expenditure, however, is far more rigid and public services cannot be trimmed or suspended arbitrarily. The current-term Government has introduced many new measures on poverty alleviation and support for the disadvantaged, such as the OALA and the Low-income Working Family Allowance (LIFA). To keep pace with the rapid ageing of our population, financial commitment on associated measures will increase at a fast rate. Take the Public Transport Fare Concession Scheme for the Elderly and Eligible Persons with Disabilities (also known as the ""$2 Public Transport Fare Concession Scheme"") and the Elderly Health Care Voucher Scheme as examples. Between 2012-13 and 2017-18, recurrent expenditure on the two schemes would see an over four-fold and ten-fold increase to nearly $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion respectively, representing a sharp growth. These are measures that benefit our community; cuts or cancellation cannot be taken lightly.', '40.Being a responsible government, we should remain vigilant. Before committing to new recurrent initiatives, we must be satisfied that these initiatives can be funded in a sustainable manner in the long run. Windfall revenue of a capital nature is no justification for substantial increases in recurrent expenditure. It is much the same as an employee who may happily spend a bit more upon receiving a large sum of year-end bonus in a certain year but would not recklessly make any unaffordable long-term financial commitment. So, in my view, in considering how our annual surplus is to be deployed, we should take into account the source and nature of the surplus, alongside the prevailing economic situation and external environment, the future needs of society and the expectations of the community, so as to ensure optimal allocation of resources.', 'Fiscal Reserves', ""41.It has also been suggested that the fiscal reserves of over $900 billion is just too much, and instead of being miserly, the Government should consider major tax cuts and step up its efforts to relieve people's hardship. While I share the view that the Government, with its existing fiscal strength, can afford to be more proactive, we should avoid reckless commitments. Public spending must be fit for purpose."", '42.Article 107 of the Basic Law stipulates that ""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall follow the principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues in drawing up its budget, and strive to achieve a fiscal balance, avoid deficits and keep the budget commensurate with the growth rate of its gross domestic product"". I agree that the implementation of this Article should not be a ""straitjacket"" which restrains our annual revenue and expenditure. Instead, there should be a certain degree of flexibility. In fact, Hong Kong, as a small externally-oriented economy, is highly susceptible to the influence of the external environment and cyclical fluctuations, and short-term fiscal imbalance is probably inevitable. Some expenditure increases are justifiable, as in the case of welfare spending since the Government is catching up on service delivery. Some other expenditure items are investments and the potential return may only be realised in future. I consider that it is most important to spend only when necessary and to act with prudence and strive for an overall fiscal balance over time.', '43.The total expenditure of the Government has increased year after year from $380 billion in 2012-13 to over $490 billion in 2017-18. Total and recurrent expenditure of the current-term Government would have respectively grown on average by 5.4 per cent and as much as 7.2 per cent per annum between 2012-13 and 2017-18. Compared with the nominal GDP growth of five per cent and government revenue growth of 3.4 per cent for the same period, expenditure growth of the current-term Government is considerable. However, the growth of government expenditure cannot keep outpacing economic growth for an undue period, lest the risk of a structural deficit would emerge.', '44.In assessing whether the level of fiscal reserves is appropriate, we ought to consider the Government\'s prevailing recurrent funding requirements and the medium- to long-term financial implications upon full implementation of policy initiatives, such as the ""$2 Public Transport Fare Concession Scheme"" and the Elderly Health Care Voucher Scheme mentioned in paragraph 39, and the enhanced OALA and the provision of subsidy in respect of the MPF ""offsetting"" arrangement as announced in this year\'s Policy Address. In addition, our medium and long-term commitments include a sum of over $300 billion for ongoing works projects and about $450 billion for civil service pension obligations in the next ten years. The Government\'s financial burden cannot be taken lightly.', ""45.To demonstrate the Government's determination in and commitment to making good use of surplus and investing in the future, we have set aside substantial resources for housing and healthcare. The Housing Reserve, which was established in 2014 to support large-scale public housing development programme, now stands at $77 billion. Last year, the Government also set aside $200 billion for the implementation of a ten-year hospital development plan to improve public healthcare facilities and services. I will make provisions for elderly services and rehabilitation services for persons with disabilities as well as sports development when determining the use of surplus for this financial year."", ""46.The economic crises caused by the financial plight of many European countries and the US in the past decade have pointed to pitfalls that Hong Kong should avoid. In fact, from 1998 to 2004 when Hong Kong's economy was ensnared in difficulties during the Asian Financial Crisis and the I&T bubble burst, government revenue plunged far more sharply than that of GDP. We experienced five years of fiscal deficits, which depleted 40 per cent or over $180 billion of our fiscal reserves, leaving these at a level equivalent to only 13 months instead of 28 months of government spending."", ""47.I believe that the two objectives of our fiscal policy are maintaining healthy public finances and strengthening resilience to withstand economic fluctuations. We should not just keep looking back to the prosperous years in the past. Instead, we should stay alert to the challenges ahead. Under the linked exchange rate system, there is very limited room to adjust our monetary policy. Therefore, we have to rely on a sound and progressive fiscal policy to ensure that we can stay strong and have adequate resources to continuously increase public investment, enhance our competitiveness, cater for social development needs and improve people's livelihood. This also enables us to promptly launch counter-cyclical measures to stabilise the economy in times of economic downturn, so as to minimise the impact of economic fluctuations on people's livelihood."", '48.Our position as an international financial centre is crucial to both Hong Kong and our country. The cornerstone of financial stability is confidence. A sound financial management philosophy and strong fiscal position of the Government are vital for maintaining international confidence in Hong Kong. We may recall how a single financial crisis has exposed the excessive budget deficits in many advanced economies in Europe and the US. A domino effect was triggered off, bringing down the international ratings of all these economies, and giving them a hard blow to their economies and financial systems. With these examples, Hong Kong must reflect on our own position seriously. Hong Kong has recently been recognised by the International Monetary Fund again for our strong policy framework, including the linked exchange rate system, vigorous regulation and supervision of the financial system and ample buffers, which enable us to cope with external economic risks.', '49.As such, we should spend only when necessary and make good use of the reserves to benefit the society. At the same time, we must maintain strict fiscal discipline and ensure that our expenditure growth will be broadly in line with affordability. We must also maintain adequate fiscal reserves to support socio-economic development, deal with emergencies and cope with the challenges posed by a rapidly ageing population.', 'Value for Money and User Pays Principles', '50.To achieve more efficient use of resources, the Government should adhere to the ""value for money"" principle, rectify unsustainable policies and adjust expenditure items that are repetitive, inappropriate and ineffective. To ensure the effective use of our public resources and to preserve the revenue base, government departments should continue to review their fees and charges in a timely manner and in accordance with the ""cost recovery"" and ""user pays"" principles.', 'Tax Policy', '51.Another topic that people frequently talk about is our tax policy. There have been calls for tax cuts, providing tax concessions to support the development of certain industries and broadening the tax base.', '52.Hong Kong has all along been maintaining a low, simple and territorial-source-based tax regime, which comprises mainly of direct taxes. As an advocate of free trade, Hong Kong does not impose duties on import or export goods except for four types of dutiable commodities. These were the key competitive advantages underpinning our success in the past. However, the global competitive environment is fast-changing. Neighbouring countries, European countries, the US and Free Trade Zones in the Mainland are using tax concession as a means to compete for investment and promote the development of targeted industries. Some countries have even adjusted their taxation structure. Recently, individual European countries and the US indicated that they would consider reducing profits tax in a bid to enhance competitiveness. Besides, the international community is taking forward measures to counter money laundering, tax base erosion and profit shifting. Hong Kong should complement these global efforts. How can we ensure that our competitive advantages would not be undermined?', ""53.With social advancement and economic development, the Government will continue to increase expenditure in social welfare, education, healthcare, housing supply, infrastructure and district facilities, etc. We should be mindful of our narrow tax base, concentration of revenue from a few industries and volatility of Government's revenue in response to economic fluctuations. Using 2015-16 as an example, revenue from land sales and profits tax accounted for 14 per cent and 31 per cent of government revenue respectively, with the financial and real estate industries contributing over 40 per cent of the profits tax receipts. Volatility in the global economy and financial market in the future or significant adjustment in asset prices will affect government revenue and fiscal affordability."", '54.As a responsible government, we have to cope with the huge expenditure needs under different economic scenarios. We cannot propose a tax cut which erodes our revenue base. Neither can we adjust our tax rates frequently as this would affect the predictability of our tax regime and dent investor confidence. We have to examine the international competitiveness of our tax regime and address the problem of a narrow tax base. I plan to set up a tax policy unit in the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau to comprehensively examine these tax issues from a macro perspective. On the one hand, we will seek to align our tax practices with international standards and actively study ways to foster the development of pillar industries, industries over which we have advantages and emerging industries through tax measures including enhanced deductions for I&T expenditure, so as to ensure that Hong Kong remains competitive and can create wealth. On the other hand, we will enhance our tax regime and explore broadening the tax base and increasing revenue, so as to ensure that adequate resources are available to support the sustainable development of our society.']"

In the same period, the Government sold three hotel sites, capable of providing some 1 900 hotel rooms.', '158.The Land Sale Programme for the coming financial year includes three commercial/business sites and one hotel site, capable of providing about 172 000 square metres of floor area and some 550 hotel rooms respectively.', '159.The Government will continue to increase the supply of commercial floor area through various means. Apart from approximately 560 000 square metres of commercial/office floor area to be released through reprovisioning the existing government facilities in the two action areas in Kwun Tong and Kowloon Bay, a number of large commercial sites will be made available to the market in the next few years. They include the Queensway Plaza site, the site on top of the terminus of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (Hong Kong Section), Site 3 of the new Central Harbourfront, the Caroline Hill Road site, the Sai Yee Street site and various sites in Kai Tak, capable of providing a total of about 1.1 million square metres of floor area.', 'Long-term Development', '160.While carrying out large-scale new land development and building up a land reserve, we need to formulate a comprehensive development strategy for meeting various challenges, especially those posed by our ageing population, ageing building stock and a shrinking workforce.

For the medium term, the average growth rate is forecast to be three per cent per annum in real terms from 2018 to 2021, broadly comparable to the trend growth of 2.9 per cent over the past decade; and the underlying inflation rate is expected to average 2.5 per cent per annum. The medium-term economic forecast is based on the assumption that there are no severe external shocks during the period, and has taken into account the impact on economic growth posed by an ageing population. That said, as the external environment is laden with uncertainties, we must remain vigilant.', ""178.The Medium Range Forecast projects, mainly from a macro perspective, the Government's expenditure requirements from 2018-19 to 2021-22. It is noteworthy that annual expenditure on infrastructure projects will soon exceed $100 billion, significantly higher than the annual average of about $40 billion as recorded by the previous-term Government. In fact, this projection has not reflected the substantial commitment which the Government will have to make for a number of land development, highways and railway projects once they are ready for rollout. Besides, over the medium term from 2018-19 to 2021-22, growth of recurrent government expenditure is estimated to range between 5.3 per cent and 9.8 per cent per annum, consistently higher than the average annual nominal economic growth of 4.5 per cent over the same period. Sustainability is an issue which deserves our attention."", '179.Regarding revenue, the land revenue estimate for 2017-18 makes reference to the Land Sale Programme and the land supply target of the year. The medium range forecast on land revenue is based on the average proportion of land revenue to GDP over the past ten years, which is 3.3 per cent of GDP. Compared with recent years, when land revenue was referenced to its average proportion to GDP in the past 30 years which is 2.8 per cent of GDP, we have taken a more aggressive assumption. I also assume that the growth rate of revenue from profits tax and other taxes will be similar to the economic growth rate in the next few years.', '180.Based on the above assumptions, I forecast an annual surplus in the Operating Account for the coming five financial years but an annual deficit would surface in the Capital Account as from 2018-19. There will be a small deficit in the Consolidated Account in 2020-21 and 2021-22. Fiscal reserves are estimated at $942.9 billion by end-March 2022, representing 30 per cent of GDP or equivalent to 18 months of government expenditure.', '181.The above estimates have not taken into account tax rebate and relief measures proposed by the Government as in previous years.', ""182.Taking all these into account, the fiscal position will be broadly-balanced in the next five years. However, pressure on government expenditure is considerably high in the face of an ageing population, a shrinking workforce, economic volatility and the Government's long-term commitments.

As I have just said, it is a vision that takes not only one or two Budgets, or even one or two terms of government, to accomplish. It is indeed a journey that we should take on together, and a goal that needs to be achieved through the concerted efforts of our community.', '186.What are our expectations of the Government nowadays? What is our ideal way of life? How can we attain a sense of well-being? Many Hong Kong people, in particular the younger generation, would answer: Happiness in life is not about earning a living, but about having the freedom to pursue higher ends. They want to have room and opportunities to realise their dreams while doing jobs that suit their interests. They want to have a decent place to live in so that they can start their own family. They want to preserve and conserve the nature and our cultural heritage, as well as enrich their lives by exploring arts and culture.

145,2011,[Introduction],"['Mr President,', 'I move that the Appropriation Bill 2011 be read a second time.', 'Introduction', '2.This is my fourth Budget.  In the past three years, we have been fighting back against the financial tsunami.  We have striven to gain a foothold in the rapidly changing global economic landscape by dealing with the various problems triggered by the crisis on the one hand, and seizing new opportunities for development on the other.  Today, our economy has fully recovered.  The employment situation has shown continuous improvement, and our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has exceeded the peak before the financial tsunami.', '3.The lessons learned from this once-in-a-century financial tsunami help shed light on how to position ourselves and make better preparations for future challenges and opportunities.  I will sum them up in four respects.', '4.First, the shifting of global economic gravity from the West to the East has become more evident.  During the financial tsunami, the sustained rapid economic growth of the Mainland brought in fresh opportunities, boosting our economic recovery.  The accelerating trade and economic integration in the region also presents enormous opportunities for Hong Kong.', '5.Second, adopting appropriate policies is vital to countering crises.  Since 2008, we have introduced five rounds of fiscal stimulus measures, which are worth $110 billion and equivalent to 6.6 per cent of our GDP.  These measures have stabilised the employment market, boosted consumer confidence and fostered economic recovery.  Our fiscal reserves have provided us with strong support for handling financial crises and created favourable conditions for economic development.', '6.Third, perseverance and confidence are crucial to overcoming crises and solving problems.  During the financial tsunami, the people of Hong Kong demonstrated flexibility and tenacity in the face of difficulties, turning crises into opportunities.  Hong Kong is a people-oriented city.  It was the interests of the people that we had in mind when we responded to the crises by implementing the strategy of “stabilising the financial system, supporting enterprises and preserving employment”.  Our focus was on maintaining social and economic stability by supporting employment.', '7.The role of the Government is, through various policies, to create a favourable environment to empower people to realise their potential and pursue their dreams and happiness.  By developing the economy, we help people create wealth and enhance their competitiveness in the face of socio-economic changes.  By developing education, people are given means for self-improvement and upward mobility.  By introducing relief measures, people in need are helped to tide over immediate difficulties.  Looking ahead, we will endeavour to create better economic conditions and open up more opportunities in society, thereby enabling everyone to share the fruits of economic growth.', '8.Fourth, the market and the community should have a more varied relationship.  Between the “big market” and the “small government”, we have a dynamic “big society”.  We should make good use of our abundant social capital, encourage further cross-sector collaboration, and unite the efforts of our people to work for the common cause of Hong Kong’s social and economic development.', '9.There are still many challenges ahead.  The Government will make continuous efforts to promote the economic development of Hong Kong, build a cohesive community and improve people’s livelihood through proper allocation and effective management of public resources.', '|']"
146,2011,[Economic Performance and Outlook],"['10.The expenditure and revenue proposals of government departments and related organisations are detailed in the Estimates.

147,2011,[Economic Performance 2010],"['Economic Performance 2010', '11.In the wake of the downturn in 2009, the economy in 2010 staged a full recovery at a faster pace than expected.  Thanks to the strong growth in the Mainland and Asia, the economy has surpassed the pre-tsunami level.  For 2010 as a whole, GDP grew by 6.8 per cent in real terms.', '12.Underpinned by the reviving global trade flows, Hong Kong’s exports of goods soared by 17.3 per cent in real terms for the year as a whole, quickly regaining the ground lost in the financial tsunami.  As the employment market improved and income increased, private consumption expenditure registered a significant growth of 5.8 per cent in 2010.  Benefiting from an upbeat business sentiment and the commencement of major infrastructure projects, the overall investment recorded a strong growth of 8.1 per cent last year.', '13.With the upturn in the economy, the job market improved significantly in the past year.  The improvement had also much to do with the great resilience and flexibility of our labour market, as well as the proven effectiveness of the Government’s measures to counter the financial tsunami.  The unemployment rate dropped from its peak in mid-2009 by 1.7 percentage points to 3.8 per cent recently.  The improvement can be seen in most trades and across all skill levels, indicating that the grass roots have really benefited from the robust economic growth.  Taking the full-time employees in the lowest tenth of income distribution as an example, their average monthly income in 2010 increased by five per cent over 2009.  After adjustment for inflation, there was still an increase of about two per cent in real terms.', '14.We expect the economy to see solid growth this year.  As the unemployment rate has already fallen back to a relatively low level, there will be limited room for further significant decline.  We also need to pay attention to the effect of the implementation of statutory minimum wage on the unemployment rate.  The generally strong economic conditions should help us through this change.', '15.Against a backdrop of a strong economic recovery, a soft US dollar and rising global food and commodity prices, inflationary pressure has gradually built up in Hong Kong this year.  The average inflation rate for 2010 as measured by the Composite Consumer Price Index was 2.4 per cent.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate was 1.7 per cent.  Taking into account the rapid economic expansion of 6.8 per cent last year, inflation for the year was rather moderate.  The significant improvement in productivity which continued throughout last year went some way towards alleviating the pressure of rising prices.', '|']"

In addition, the European and the US economies face uncertainties on the recovery path.  Deleveraging and high unemployment are expected to linger on.  All these will pose challenges for the global economy.', '17.The relatively stronger growth sustained by the Mainland and Asian economies will continue to benefit Hong Kong.  But the relatively fragile economic recovery of the US and Europe will make this year a testing time for the export performance of Asia and Hong Kong.  I forecast GDP growth of four to five per cent for the year. ', '18.The risk of rising inflation is mounting in Asia.  The soft US dollar and possible sustained increase in global food and commodity prices will put more inflationary pressure on Hong Kong.  On top of these, the continued rise in the Mainland’s food prices and local rentals are expected to have a more noticeable effect on our inflation this year.

I have repeatedly reminded the public that an environment with abundant liquidity and ultra-low interest rates will not last forever.  People should carefully assess the risks and their own financial position when making a home purchase decision.  To ensure socio-economic stability by forestalling the risk of a property bubble, I introduced three rounds of measures in February, April and August last year to ensure the healthy and stable development of the property market.  In October, the Chief Executive also announced a series of short, medium and long-term measures in his Policy Address.  These measures have to a certain extent achieved the intended effects of increasing flat supply, enhancing transparency in the property market, and preventing excessive expansion in mortgage lending.', '21.The US’s second round of quantitative easing measures worth US$600 billion announced in November last year has fuelled the already buoyant property market.  The excessive fund flows have led to exuberant speculative activities, and short-term resale transactions have surged sharply.  The exuberance has even spread from the luxury market to the mass market.  To curb speculative activities, we have introduced a Special Stamp Duty on short-term resale of residential properties.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has also further tightened the loan-to-value ratio for mortgages made by banks.', '22.With the introduction of these measures, there was an immediate reduction of speculative activities.  The number of residential property transactions in January plunged by 39 per cent over November to around 8 000 cases, of which short-term resale cases fell 34 per cent.  In December, the number of new mortgage applications likewise fell sharply by 37 per cent over the previous month.  Although the figures for January are not yet complete, a preliminary examination shows that flat prices were up by two to three per cent in January after falling 0.9 per cent in December.  There are also signs of pick-up in the turnover of residential flats lately.  The pick-up of late conceivably reflects the strength of the demand from genuine end users and long-term investors.  Notwithstanding this, we will remain vigilant against the possible risk of a property bubble posed by excessive liquidity and exceptionally low interest rates.  We are determined to maintain the stable and healthy development of the property market and will continue to monitor closely the market situation.

This will altogether provide some 16 000 residential flats, an increase of more than 70 per cent over the 9 000 or so flats provided in 2010-11.  The Secretary for Development will explain in detail later the land sale arrangement for next year.', '27.Along with the above-station projects at Nam Cheong, Tsuen Wan, Tai Wai, Tin Shui Wai and Tseung Kwan O, the two redevelopment sites of the Urban Renewal Authority, and the annual average supply from lease modifications and private redevelopment projects for which lease modification is not required, it is estimated that housing land available in the coming year will provide a total of 30 000 to 40 000 private residential flats, far exceeding the target of an annual average of 20 000 flats.  In response to my request, the West Rail Property Development Limited has redesigned six property developments above MTR stations along the West Rail in respect of which master layout plans and building plans have been approved.

The quantitative easing, while causing more hot money to flow into Asia, also raises inflation expectations, leading to a greater inflation risk in the region.', '40.Hikes in food prices and housing rents are of particular relevance to consumer price inflation.  Local food prices go up mainly because of similar rises in the international and Mainland markets.  Rents of private housing rebounded since April 2009 and registered an accumulated increase of 36 per cent at the end of last year, surpassing the pre-tsunami peak by nearly five per cent.  As the tenancies expire, the rental increase over the recent past will be reflected in the new tenancies, thereby pushing up consumer price inflation in the short run.  The measures to stabilise the property market introduced last November have effectively curtailed speculative activities and should divert more flats back to the leasing market.  This will help ease the pressure of rental rise, though the effects will take some time to come through.', '|']"

As Hong Kong is an externally-oriented economy with a linked exchange rate system, we cannot use interest rate as a tool to contain inflation and are therefore relatively passive in this respect.  In general, other economies in the region are also facing inflationary pressure, despite the different exchange rate systems they are using.  In the short term, the Government will strive to ease the domestically generated price pressure by forestalling property market exuberance, preventing excessive credit growth and pursuing a prudent fiscal policy.', '42.In the face of surging food prices, we will continue to diversify the sources of our food imports.  This year, one of the key policy directions of the Mainland is to contain inflation and manage inflation expectations.  Hong Kong will be able to fight inflation more effectively if the Mainland’s inflation is brought under control.', '43.In the medium to long term, we must keep enhancing our productivity to alleviate the inflationary pressure.  In the next few years, the Government will continue to invest heavily in infrastructure, thus increasing the capacity and efficiency of our overall economy.  These efforts will not only promote economic development and provide job opportunities, but also help reduce the risk of hyperinflation in the medium to long term.', '44.Regarding macroeconomic management, we will adopt a counter-cyclical fiscal strategy to contain the growth of government expenditure.

The Programme comprises two parts, one on issuing bonds to institutional investors and the other to retail investors.  As at end-December 2010, government bonds worth $24 billion were issued under the Institutional Bond Issuance Programme.  For retail bonds, the current low-interest rate environment has reduced the attractiveness of conventional fixed-rate bonds to retail investors.  Inflation-linked retail bonds are a preferable option for initiating the retail bond issuance.  I believe that this will help enhance retail investors’ understanding of the bond market and increase their interest in bond investment.', '46.The issuance of inflation-linked retail bonds, or “iBond”, will help reduce the impact of inflation on our people.  A low-interest rate environment with an inflationary trend will inevitably erode the purchasing power of household savings.  I will issue                   $5 billion to $10 billion worth of Hong Kong-dollar iBond under the Government Bond Programme.  This will provide our citizens with another investment option for coping with inflation while promoting the development of the local retail bond market.', '47.Our preliminary plan is to issue iBond with a maturity of three years to Hong Kong residents.

This will cost the Government about $4.7 billion;', 'Waiving rates for 2011-12, subject to a ceiling of $1,500 per quarter for each rateable property.  It is estimated that about 82 per cent of properties will be subject to no rates in the year.  This proposal will cost the Government approximately $9.9 billion;', ""Paying two months' rent for public housing tenants.

For non-elderly tenants of the HKHS's Group B estates, the Government will pay                       two-thirds of their rent for two months.  This measure will involve expenditure of approximately $1.9 billion; and"", 'Providing an extra allowance to Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) recipients, equal to one month of the standard rate CSSA payments; and an extra allowance to Old Age Allowance and Disability Allowance recipients, equal to one month of the allowances.  This proposal will involve an additional expenditure of about $1.9 billion.', '49.The above measures aim to alleviate the burden of electricity charges, rates and public housing rents on the public.  As in the past, CSSA recipients who do not have to bear rates or public housing rents will not obtain any pecuniary advantage from the rates waiver and the government payment of public housing rents.  They will, however, receive an extra allowance, along with other CSSA recipients, to ease the pressure of inflation.', '50.In addition, the short-term food assistance services funded by the Government, which have achieved satisfactory results since implementation, provide immediate support to people in need.  The operating organisations have the discretion to provide assistance beyond the specified period in exceptional circumstances.  Given the stable utilisation of the services, the funding already allocated should be sufficient for financing the operation of the services until 2013.  The Social Welfare Department (SWD) will closely monitor the demand for the services and the related arrangements.  I have also reserved an additional $100 million for the continuation of the services as and when needed.', '51.In addition to the above one-off measures, to alleviate the burdens of people in supporting their parents and raising their children, I also propose:', 'Increasing the allowance for maintaining dependent parents/grandparents by 20 per cent.  The allowance for maintaining a dependent parent/grandparent aged 60 or above will increase from the present $30,000 to $36,000.  At the same time, the additional allowance for a taxpayer residing with his/her parent/grandparent will increase from $30,000 to $36,000.  The allowance for maintaining a dependent parent/grandparent aged between 55 and 59 will increase from the current $15,000 to $18,000.  The same increase applies to the additional allowance for taxpayers residing with these parents/grandparents.  For taxpayers whose parents/grandparents are admitted to a residential care home, the deduction ceiling for elderly residential care expenses will be raised from the current $60,000 to $72,000.

But I would like to point out that the government expenditure for   2011-12 is estimated at $371.1 billion, an increase of 22 per cent over this year.

With the implementation of our stimulus measures, the economic recovery has become more entrenched.  This, coupled with the better-than-expected rebound of the global economy, particularly that of the Mainland, has enabled Hong Kong to achieve a GDP growth of 6.8 per cent in 2010, which is higher than the original estimate.', '54.Income levels rose in parallel, leading to an increase in the revenues from profits tax and salaries tax, for which the revised estimate reaches $140.5 billion, higher than the original estimate by $22.2 billion.

For example, borrowers will be allowed to draw in advance a certain amount of loans from banks in case of special needs to pay for medical expenses, building maintenance fees, etc.  The amount of annuity payable to single borrowers will be raised while the fees for joining the scheme will be lowered or waived as far as possible.  These changes are made to better meet the needs of the elderly, providing them with an alternative to improve their standard of living.

Despite all the road improvement works to ease traffic congestion, average vehicle speeds on all strategic roads across the territory decreased by over five per cent in 2010.  Allowing the situation to deteriorate would make our roads even more congested.

Of the recurrent expenditure, 56.4 per cent will be used in the three policy area groups of education, health and social welfare.  Recurrent expenditure for 2011-12 will increase by nearly eight per cent when compared with 2010-11.  This reflects that the Government is always committed to caring for people’s livelihood.  Taking into account the provision for meeting service growth, and the measures proposed in the Policy Address and in this Budget, operating expenditure for 2011-12 will be higher than that for 2010-2011 by 24 per cent.', '181.I forecast that capital expenditure will amount to $73.1 billion, including   $58.3 billion on capital works.  Total government expenditure is estimated to reach $371.1 billion, an increase of $67.6 billion over 2010-11.  Public expenditure will be equivalent to 21 per cent of our GDP.  The estimated government expenditure for 2011-12 is $136.3 billion, or 58 per cent, higher than 2007-08.  The increase is also greater than the 15.8 per cent nominal GDP growth over the same period.', '182.I estimate that total government revenue for 2011-12 will be $375 billion.  Taking all these into account, I forecast a surplus of $3.6 billion in the Operating Account and a surplus of $300 million in the Capital Account.  This will result in a surplus of $3.9 billion in the Consolidated Account, equivalent to 0.2 per cent of our GDP.

The new economic landscape has provided welcome opportunities for many sectors and people in Hong Kong.  However, the unusual external environment has given rise to inflationary pressure and increased the risk of asset-price bubbles, adding to the burden on our citizens.  In such exceptional circumstances, it is only natural that some people feel worried about the increasingly heavy burden they have to bear or the difficulty in clinching a place in the new economic contest.  They may even be anxious about their development prospects for the future.', '185.In view of this year’s socio-economic conditions, I propose in this Budget to increase our spending on areas related to people’s livelihood, such as education, health and social welfare.

With fairness and care, we can create a vibrant socio-economic environment in which everyone can realise their potential.', '188.In my last Budget, I pointed out that we should make good use of the “big society” which exists somewhere between the “big market” and the “small government”.

217,2020,Introduction,"['Mr President,Honourable Members and fellow citizens,', 'I move that the Appropriation Bill 2020 be read a second time.', 'Introduction', '2.2019 was an unsettling year fraught with obstacles and an unforgettable one for all Hong Kong people.', '3.Early last year, we had already foreseen that our economy would be subject to considerable uncertainties due to the US-China trade conflict and other external factors. However, no one could have predicted that social incidents would break out in the middle of the year, which not only hit our economy but also broke our hearts. Before we could sort things out, there was an unexpected outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease.', '4.Preventing and fighting against the epidemic, as well as deploying resources to alleviate the pressure on enterprises and the general public are our top priority. Last week, we established the $30 billion Anti-epidemic Fund to relieve the burden on those industries and employees in the eye of the storm.', '5.In preparing this Budget, I put the focus on ""supporting enterprises, safeguarding jobs, stimulating the economy and relieving people\'s burden"". I am well aware that financial resources alone are not enough to tackle the challenges we are facing. However, making good use of fiscal reserves to support enterprises and relieve people\'s hardship is certainly in line with our people\'s expectations towards the Government under the current difficult environment.', ""6.Therefore, I have decided to implement counter-cyclical measures of a massive scale involving above $120 billion so as to meet the public's expectations as far as possible. Although a record high deficit is envisaged in next year's budget, I believe that only with such a budget can we help our community and local enterprises ride out their difficulties. I will go into more details about this in the ensuing paragraphs. ""]"
218,2020,EconomicSituation in 2019,"['EconomicSituation in 2019', ""7.The external environment was exceptionally austere in 2019. Confronted by the slowdown in growth across most economies and US-China trade conflict, Hong Kong's total exports of goods fell by 4.7 per cent in real terms for the year as a whole. Hit by the violent social incidents, exports of travel services plunged and led to a fall of 10.4 per cent in exports of services for 2019 as a whole, the largest annual decline on record."", '8.On domestic demand, private consumption expenditure began to weaken in the first half of 2019, and deteriorated abruptly in the second half of the year, resulting in a decline of 1.1 per cent in real terms for the year. Investment expenditure fell by 12.3 per cent in real terms amid subdued business confidence.', ""9.Hong Kong's economy was already quite weak in the first half of 2019. Dragged by a host of headwinds, the economy entered recession in the third quarter and contracted by 1.2 per cent for the year as a whole, the first annual decline since the great recession of 2009."", '10.As the economic situation worsened, the labour market gradually slackened. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate went up from 2.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2019 to the latest 3.4 per cent, the highest in more than three years. Employment situations in many sectors came under pressure. The unemployment rate of the retail, accommodation and food services sectors as a whole rose to a three-year high of 5.2 per cent. The unemployment rate of the food and beverage services sector even rose sharply to 6.1 per cent, the highest in eight years, and its underemployment rate also went up substantially. Besides, household incomes began to weaken in the second half of 2019.', ""11.Overall price pressures remained largely moderate. However, consumer price inflation went up in the second half of 2019, mainly reflecting the sharp increase in prices of basic foodstuffs amid reduced supply of fresh pork. Netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate was 3 per cent for 2019, up 0.4 percentage point from 2018. ""]"
219,2020,EconomicOutlook for 2020 andMedium-term Outlook,"['EconomicOutlook for 2020 andMedium-term Outlook', '12.Entering 2020, the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus has dealt a severe blow to economic activities and sentiment in Hong Kong. The tourism- and consumption-related sectors, already hard hit by the social unrest, are suffering from a more serious setback and entering a ""harsh winter"". Although the impact of the epidemic on our economy in the near term could possibly be greater than that of the SARS outbreak in 2003, and the labour market is also subject to significant pressure, Hong Kong\'s economic fundamentals remain solid and therefore our core competitiveness will not be shaken. The economy of Hong Kong should be able to recover once the epidemic is over.', '13.On the Mainland, while its economy showed some deceleration, it still recorded a solid growth of 6.1 per cent for 2019 as a whole. Regarding the economic outlook for this year, the US-China trade relations remain complex and constantly evolving, and the near-term economic performance is also facing notable downward pressure from the novel coronavirus epidemic. Nonetheless, economic fundamentals of the Mainland are solid and there are adequate policy tools to maintain macro-economic stability. Once the epidemic is over, the growth of the Mainland economy is expected to continue to outpace that of other major economies.', '14.On the external front, the global economy is still struggling and the growth momentum of many advanced economies remains feeble. Although the economic growth in the US eased last year, the resilient labour market would still continue to support private consumption. Nevertheless, market forecasts generally point to a further growth moderation in the US economy this year. Besides, economic growth of the euro area would remain modest this year amid subdued manufacturing activities.', ""15.After the consumption tax hike in October last year, Japan's economy has already seen visible downward pressure. This, coupled with structural issues such as an ageing population and huge public debt, suggests that economic growth should be rather subdued this year. Elsewhere in Asia, the emerging economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will likely continue to see solid economic growth in the medium to long term given resilient domestic demand. "", '16.The development of US-China trade relations is the most significant uncertain factor facing the global economy. Moreover, the geopolitical risks in the Middle East and uncertainties surrounding the Brexit negotiations could possibly send shocks to the global financial market and slow down economic recovery.', '17.The outbreak of the novel coronavirus epidemic will also affect production and transportation in the Mainland and Asia as well as the global supply chain operation. This will deal a further blow to the global economy. The International Monetary Fund has therefore lowered the Mainland and global economic growth forecasts for this year recently.', ""18.To sum up, Hong Kong's economy is facing enormous challenges this year. The outlook is far from promising in the near term. Having regard to the stimulus effect of the fiscal measures, I forecast our economy will grow by -1.5 per cent to 0.5 per cent in real terms in 2020."", '19.On inflation, global inflation is expected to remain modest. Subdued local economic conditions in the near term will contain the upward pressure on local costs. The moderation in residential rentals will also help lower overall inflation. Taking the various factors into account, I forecast that the headline inflation rate and underlying inflation rate will ease to 1.7 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively in 2020.', ""20.On property market, the residential property market has been largely quiet since last June with transactions and prices generally retreating. Yet, the current flat prices are still out of line with economic fundamentals and people's affordability. The Government will continue its endeavour to increase land and housing supply."", '21.In the medium term, the economic outlook of Hong Kong remains positive. The development of our country and Asia will continue to be the key driving force of global growth. Given the huge market potential of the Mainland as well as the opportunities brought by the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area), Hong Kong can leverage its strengths, grasp the opportunities and explore greater room for development.', ""22.Yet, on the other hand, we have to strive to overcome the constraints stemming from ageing population, a dwindling labour force and shortage of land. The social incidents also reveal that there are conflicts to be addressed. Balancing the various factors, I forecast Hong Kong's economy will grow by an average of 2.8 per cent per annum in real terms from 2021 to 2024, slightly lower than the trend growth of 2.9 per cent over the past decade.

Our nation has to step up macroeconomic adjustment and adopt a tight monetary policy as well as other measures to curb inflation and raise economic efficiency.  In the short term, such measures will have a bearing on Hong                           Kong's economy as well as a direct impact on many investors."", '11.

While the slowdown in growth of advanced economies in Europe and the US will have some impact on the economies of emerging markets and the Mainland, the sustained rapid economic growth of the Mainland and its increasingly intensified economic integration with Hong Kong will greatly promote our economic development and cushion the impact of the slowdown on Hong Kong.  The economic fundamentals in Asia remain strong, which will help to improve our external trade performance and consolidate our position as                            Asia's world city.  Local interest rate cuts, following those in the US, will also stimulate economic growth."", ""14.

The rapid development of our nation is transforming the global economic landscape.  After 30 years of reform and liberalisation, the increasing integration of the Mainland with the global economy and the urbanisation and industrialisation in the Mainland have progressively changed the mode of economic development, boosting domestic consumption in terms of both quality and quantity, driving manufacturing industries up the value chain and speeding up the development of the service industries.  These developments have helped our economy shift towards higher value-added services, thereby supporting our economic growth."", '21.                            Hong Kong has the unique advantage of having the Mainland as our hinterland while maintaining an international outlook.  We have been fostering cooperation and integration with the Mainland through the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement and the Pan-Pearl River Delta (Pan-PRD) Regional Co-operation Framework Agreement.  With the gradual implementation of the Action Agenda put forward in the Economic Summit of                           ""China\'s 11th Five-Year Plan and the Development of Hong                           Kong"", we can enhance our role in the development of our nation.  In addition, by expanding the scope for functional division and cooperation between Hong Kong and Mainland cities, mutual benefit can be achieved.  With these advantages, we can also attract investors from both the Mainland and overseas to use Hong Kong as a platform for developing regional and international business.', '22.                            Hong Kong has a sound legal system, a free flow of information, a well-established, strong and effective global network, and entrenched intellectual property rights protection.  Hong Kong also boasts an open and highly cost-effective business environment, and has a huge Mainland market as our hinterland.  These are the key elements for Hong Kong to attract local and overseas investors.  We must co-operate with the Mainland, in particular the Pan-PRD region, in promoting to these investors the overall package in order to enhance our attractiveness.', ""23.

The Government is making untiring efforts to help our enterprises develop economic relations with emerging markets.  In the past few months, we have led delegations of different sectors to Russia, Vietnam, India and the Middle East.  We will continue to extend and strengthen these international ties.

On the external front, globalisation and the emerging regional economies will bring increasing competition to Hong Kong.  The global economic landscape has been changing rapidly in the past 20 to 30 years.  The application of information technology, enhanced efficiency in transportation and logistics management, liberalisation and integration of financial markets in various economies and the rise of emerging markets all pose new challenges to Hong Kong.  The Mainland economy is now at a crucial stage of change in its mode of development, with continuous restructuring and upgrading of Mainland industries.  The rapid development and progress of Mainland cities will also bring more competition to Hong Kong.', ""27.                           In a report released at the end of last year, the International Monetary Fund pointed out that further financial liberalisation in the Mainland is likely to consolidate Hong                           Kong's position as an international financial centre over the medium term.  However, with the modernisation of the                           Mainland's financial system and the development of other financial centres in the Mainland, Hong                           Kong's comparative advantage in China-related intermediation may diminish.  To maintain its long-term standing as an international financial centre, Hong Kong must build a geographically diverse base for its financial services in the region."", ""28.                           Apart from looking at expansion in regional financial services, we must maintain and promote Hong                           Kong's role as an international cosmopolitan city.  We will continue to expand our capacity to handle trading and financial issues and broaden our international horizon through access to more overseas markets and by establishing stronger international links.  We will further ease business operations, improve the transparency of our regulatory regime, streamline procedures, encourage creative ideas and promote the use of technology.  These will help economic restructuring, reduce business compliance costs and enhance our ability to meet the challenges brought by globalisation and by rapid integration with the Mainland economy."", ""29.                           For a highly developed city, global competition is ultimately a competition for talent.

The number of people aged 65 or above is expected to rise sharply in the next 20 to 30 years.  At present, one in eight persons in Hong Kong is in this group.  By 2033, only 25 years away, that figure rises to one in four persons.', '32.                           Meanwhile, the working age population will begin to fall gradually after 2014.  The increasing elderly population will increase the burden on the working population.  At present, every two elderly persons are supported by about 12 people of working age.  By 2033, however, every two elderly persons will be supported by only about five people of working age.  This means that the burden on each working person will more than double.  Therefore, unless there is a substantial increase in labour productivity, an ageing population will lower our standard of living and undermine economic vitality and competitiveness.  We must make preparations now for the future.', '33.                           An ageing population will also put immense pressure on public finances.  On the revenue side, the tax base from salaries tax will become increasingly narrow because of the decrease in working population.  At the same time, expenditures closely related to the elderly, such as medical, long-term care expenses and social security payments, will increase substantially.  Therefore, we must endeavour to enhance productivity, control expenditure and invest today in measures that will help to mitigate future pressures on public finance.', '                           |  ']"

Since reunification, we have, through various schemes, attracted more than 200 000 talented people to Hong Kong.  We have recently relaxed the age limit and the requirements on language proficiency and work experience for the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme and the arrangements for non-local students to work in Hong Kong after graduation, with a view to attracting more talented young people to our city.  We will make better use of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices around the world to step up the external promotion of the various talent admission schemes and the arrangements for non-local students to work in Hong Kong.', '36.                           The Government has been investing heavily in education.  This has generally raised the education level of the local workforce and prepared us for further development as a knowledge-based economy.  In the long run, enhancing the skills and competitiveness of people of all ages through continuous efforts to raise their education level and encourage lifelong learning will help to increase our per capita productivity, thereby alleviating the problems caused by our shrinking                           workforce.', '                           |  ']"

Currently, nearly half of the total expenditure of the Hospital Authority is used to provide health care services for the elderly.  The cost of providing such services to the elderly is on average six times that for other groups.', '38.                           On the other hand, advances in medical technology, the use of new diagnostic techniques, new drugs and new treatment methods all combine to continually drive up medical costs.  Because of these factors, it is expected that the increase in overall expenditure on health care services will, on average, be two percentage points higher than the actual economic growth rate in the next 20 to 30 years.', '39.                           According to an external study, if the existing health care system were to remain unchanged, expenditure on public health care services would increase from $38 billion in 2004 to over $180 billion in 2033, an increase of almost 400 per cent in real terms.  The share of the cost of public health care services could increase substantially from the present 15 per cent of government recurrent expenditure to over 27 per cent.  Although we will increase the share of public health care expenditure to 17 per cent of government recurrent expenditure in the next few years, there is still a big gap between this figure and the forecast expenditure on public health care services for 2033.  If we do not introduce new financing arrangements, the provision of quality public health care services cannot be sustained.', '                           |  ']"

However, government welfare expenditure on the elderly has increased steadily.  The operating expenditure of the Social Welfare Department on services for the elderly rose from $1.44 billion in 1996-97 to $3.08 billion in 2006-07, an increase of over 100 per cent.

These principles are all very familiar to you, and I think there is no need for me to explain them again.', '44.                           In drawing up the first Budget of the Government of this term, I have strictly adhered to three basic principles.  First, the Budget should demonstrate the Government’s commitment to our society; second, financial policies should be sustainable; and third, we should be pragmatic in decision making.  By following these principles, we strive to ensure that the measures proposed in this Budget respond to the aspirations of the community and lay a solid foundation for our economy to meet future challenges.', '                           |  ']"

I am aware that recent inflation has brought pressure to bear on the public.  We must understand that inflation is partly driven by our strong economic growth and that a vibrant economy is beneficial to our people.  Our declining unemployment rate is one of the indicators reflecting this situation.  Nonetheless, I am deeply concerned about the fact that some disadvantaged groups have not yet been able to enjoy the fruits of economic growth.  I believe that, through proper revenue and expenditure proposals, this Budget can help improve their lives.', '47.                           It is the duty of the Government to provide a final safety net for those who cannot help themselves.  Concern over the livelihood of low-income families has now become a consensus in our community.  In line with this consensus, I will propose measures to help them.', ""48.                           The Chief Executive has clearly stated in his Policy Address that the Government should not attempt to narrow the wealth gap by redistributing wealth through high levels of tax and welfare.

267,2008,[Sustainability],"['50.                           My second principle in managing public finances is that our financial policies should be sustainable.  If we increase recurrent public expenditure or reduce recurrent public revenue, we must be able to give reasonable assurances that the changes can sustain themselves.', '51.                           Recently, there have been calls for the Government to make good use of the fiscal surplus and return wealth to the people.  I share this view.  This year, with our economy performing well, our tax revenue has increased.  Revenues from stamp duty and land premium income, in particular, are far higher than expected.  However, we must realise that a substantial surplus will not occur every year.  Temporary improvements in our fiscal position, therefore, are not sufficient reasons for significant increases in recurrent expenditure or reductions in tax.', '52.                           Thus, in studying the feasibility of increasing recurrent expenditure, we must examine carefully the sustainability of each proposed measure.  We must avoid measures that impose burdens that the community will find hard to bear in the long run.', '53.                           Article 107 of the Basic Law stipulates that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall follow the principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues in drawing up its budget, and strive to achieve a fiscal balance and avoid deficits.  To ensure fiscal sustainability, I will strive to achieve fiscal balance over the next five years.  I may introduce one-off measures which will increase government expenditure in the short term if there are needs in the community and our finances permit.', ""54.                           Past Budgets have been formulated to meet the prevailing needs of the community.  For example, Hong                           Kong's economy declined substantially after the Asian financial crisis and the SARS outbreak.  The Chief Executive and the Financial Secretary at the time, faced with swelling deficits, took unpopular measures to increase revenues and reduce expenditure.

A big market can increase the share of the private sector in the economy and allow market forces to allocate our limited resources in the most efficient way for the maximum benefit of the community as a whole.  A small government can prevent the public sector from acquiring excessive resources and thus reducing efficiency in the allocation and use of resources.  Moreover, a small government can minimise regulation, thereby facilitating business operations and attracting overseas investment.  However, we will also keep government expenditure in line with economic growth to ensure that our services can meet the changing needs of the community.', ""59.                           We should adopt a pragmatic approach to the problem of the narrow tax base of Hong Kong.

The main items that brought in higher-than-expected revenues were stamp duty on stock transfers which generated $35 billion ($22.1 billion higher than the original estimates), stamp duty on property transactions which generated $14.6 billion ($5.1 billion higher), profits tax which generated $89 billion ($11.5 billion higher) and salaries tax which generated $37 billion ($7 billion higher).', '65.

In the past few months, I have heard people discussing cases of the elderly relying on the Old Age Allowance for their living and calls for the Government to increase the allowance.  I am very concerned about such cases because the existing safety net provided by CSSA should be able to give them adequate assistance.  According to some media reports, the elderly people concerned are not eligible for CSSA because they own self-occupied properties.  As a matter of fact, under the existing system, owning a self-occupied property does not affect the eligibility of elderly people for CSSA.  The elderly in need can contact the Social Welfare Department early to have their eligibility assessed.', '158.                           With an ageing population, the number of elderly people is expected to increase from the current 870 000 to about 2.17 million by 2033, or two and a half times the present population.  The expenditure on the Old Age Allowance will increase accordingly, in today’s money, from $3.9 billion in 2008 to $9.7 billion in 2033, posing a considerable burden to public finances in the long run.  If the Old Age Allowance were increased to $1,000 for each eligible person, by 2033 expenditure would surge to $14 billion.  In the long run, this measure would be unsustainable, and the expenditure involved would become a heavy burden on the community.', '159.                           I agree that the Government should provide more assistance to the elderly in need.  We must explore a feasible                           long-term option for the Old Age Allowance.  While the option should provide adequate assistance to the elderly in need to ensure the proper use of public money, it should also be a sustainable and affordable one for the community.  We hope that such an option can gain the general support of the public.', '160.                           The issue we need to resolve is how additional assistance could be provided to the elderly in need but without further increasing the burden of the Old Age Allowance Scheme on public finances in the long run.  Subject to this overriding principle, the Government is willing to consider any option, such as identifying the elderly in need through means tests and re-deploying resources to render them more appropriate assistance.', '161.                           The Labour and Welfare Bureau will conduct in-depth studies on how to improve the Old Age Allowance Scheme and seek views from various sectors of the community.

Now, in 2014, we have reached a crucial juncture. We must work together to prepare ourselves for the future, to strengthen further our solid foundation for the well-being of this generation and the next."", '3.The community is now discussing the methods for selecting the Chief Executive in 2017 and for forming the Legislative Council in 2016. I fervently hope that the community will set aside differences, reach a consensus and chart a course towards universal suffrage.', '4.On the economic front, the external environment last year was mixed with the US Federal Reserve Board changing towards the end of the year the quantitative easing policy which it has sustained for years. It is likely that there will be larger and more frequent capital flows into and out of Hong Kong. We must be prepared to withstand the inevitable volatility while adapting to the underlying changes in the global landscape to open up opportunity for future development.', '5.Last month, the Chief Executive delivered a wide ranging Policy Address with over 160 measures benefiting a broad spectrum of the community. The additional expenditure involved is $25 billion. I shall ensure that financial resources are adequate to fully support the early launch of the relevant initiatives to meet the aspirations of the public.', '6.I set up the Working Group on Long-Term Fiscal Planning to explore ways to make more comprehensive planning for our public finances to cope with an ageing population and other long-term commitments. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the experts and scholars in the Working Group for their hard work in the past six months or so as well as their independent and professional analyses and recommendations. The Working Group\'s report points out that, with an ageing population and a shrinking workforce, economic and revenue growth would decelerate; a structural deficit would be inevitable if expenditure growth outpaces revenue growth in a persistent manner. This reminds us of the importance of ""living within our means"" and ""fiscal prudence"". Government will keep the overall fiscal health in view and take timely targeted measures to ensure the sustainability of public finances.', ""7.Competitiveness is the theme of this Budget. I shall set out proposals on bolstering Hong Kong's position as an international hub, the promotion of industries, the keys and limits to development, and fiscal sustainability. I believe that the proposed measures will enhance our competitiveness, help keep Hong Kong's economy growing, improve our business environment, increase employment opportunities and maintain the health of public finances. With all this in place, I hope that everyone in the community will be able to realise their potential, live a better life and pursue their aspirations.""]"

Possible market fluctuations and the risk of reversal of capital flows will cast shadows over global economic growth this year."", '14.The Eurozone has pulled out of recession. However, the root problems have yet to be solved, the financial markets are feeble, and unemployment rates are high. Fundamentals are still weak and, as a result, the economic recovery will remain sluggish.', ""15.Japan's government debt has reached as high as two and a half times the country's GDP. The economy, while being troubled by the threat of deflation, lacked momentum over the past two decades. It remains to be seen whether the economy will be able to maintain its growth trend propped up by the Japanese government's quantitative easing programme last year."", '16.The fiscal issues faced by these advanced economies have features in common, namely imbalanced fiscal structures, high debts and high unemployment rates. The governments of these economies adopted expansionary policies to boost economic growth and employment, but the need to mend public finances and reduce fiscal deficits give rise to contractionary pressures. Such contradictory policies would intensify social conflicts and unrest and make the road to economic recovery even more bumpy. Hong Kong must learn from their lessons.', '17.Ultra-low interest rates and abundant liquidity under the loose global monetary environment have exposed emerging markets to risks of all kinds, including bursting of asset-price bubbles, greater volatilities of stock prices and exchange rates and intensified inflation pressure. This will dampen their economic growth and performance.', '18.The geopolitical uncertainties in many parts of the world are still a cause for concern in the coming year. It is difficult to predict what will happen.', '19.The faster economic growth in the Mainland provides crucial support to the regional economy. In Hong Kong, local consumption prospects remain positive, inbound visitor numbers continue to grow and major infrastructure works are steaming ahead, all fuelling domestic demand; the weak external environment is also expected to show some improvement.', '20.I forecast GDP growth of three to four per cent in 2014, lower than the average annual growth rate of 4.5 per cent over the past decade. As for unemployment rate, barring any external shocks, the labour market is expected to remain in a state of full employment.', '21.On inflation, global economic growth and inflation are likely to stay modest, and global food prices should hold steady by and large. Domestically, the uptrend of factor costs is tapering off. This, coupled with the markedly slower rise in rentals for fresh-letting of flats and shops last year, will help ease inflation pressure this year. I forecast that the headline inflation for 2014 will average 4.6 per cent and underlying inflation at 3.7 per cent.', '22.Low interest rates and abundant liquidity have seen the local property market out of line with economic fundamentals, with heightened risk of a bubble. Before the supply-demand situation of the property market regains its balance, Government must continue with its demand-side management measures. These serve to forestall an increased risk of a property bubble that would hamper our macro-economic and financial stability.

On the one hand, we should understand our advantages and limitations, and consolidate our time-honoured success model. On the other hand, we should adapt to evolving circumstances.', ""24.Hong Kong's economic success over the years owes much to our efforts to grasp the opportunities presented by our country's development, to our steadfast commitment to free market principles and to our firm positioning as a world city.

At the same time, we must nurture with patience new industries which have potential and international competitiveness. By doing so, we are opening up more new opportunities for our future economic development.', ""31.Manpower, land supply and an ageing population are the major constraints to Hong Kong's future development.

The AA is preparing the detailed project cost, formulating budgets and examining viable financing options, which include increasing recurrent revenue, issuing bonds and keeping its operating surplus as reserves. Government will support the financing of the project.', '37.Upon the commissioning of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge in 2016, the development potential of Lantau Island will be significantly enhanced as the island transforms from the western end of Hong Kong into the centre of the Pearl River Delta (PRD). It will then take one hour to travel from Hong Kong to Macao and Zhuhai, three hours to most of the major towns and cities of the Western PRD, and about one day to major cities in Indochina such as Hanoi.

I pledged in the 2008-09 Budget to earmark $50 billion to support healthcare reform. The Food and Health Bureau will shortly consult the public on the details of the scheme. I shall consider providing tax reliefs for subscribers of regulated insurance products after a consensus is reached in the community.', '127.Disease prevention and control forms an important line of defence in public health. Government has endeavoured to strengthen primary care, including proactively promoting healthy living, as well as strengthening disease prevention strategies and surveillance systems, with a view to lowering risks of disease and hence expenditure on healthcare. In the coming five years, Government will allocate additional funding of over $420 million for the study and implementation of a pilot programme to subsidise colorectal cancer screening for specific age groups.', '128.Studies by the World Health Organization (WHO) and others point out that increasing tobacco duty is an effective means of tobacco control to lower the health risks of the public. It helps reduce direct medical expenses caused by smoking and second-hand smoking. To safeguard public health, I propose to increase the duty on cigarettes by 20 cents per stick with immediate effect. This will bring the proportion of tobacco duty to the retail price of cigarettes to about 70 per cent which meets the minimum level recommended by WHO. I wish to emphasise that this is not a budgetary measure to increase revenue. We shall continue to strengthen smoking cessation services, as well as publicity and law enforcement on tobacco control. The Customs and Excise Department will step up enforcement against different forms of illicit cigarette trading.']"
377,2014,[Public Finances],"[""129.The Working Group on Long-Term Fiscal Planning was set up last June. Economists and experts from the accounting, tax and actuarial fields were invited to explore ways for our public finances to cope with an ageing population and long-term financial commitments. The Working Group performed a health check on the current state of Hong Kong's public finances and made projections of Government's long-term fiscal position up to 2041-42, having regard to demographic trends, economic growth and prevailing policies. The detailed results will be released next week."", ""130.According to the Working Group's analysis, Government's overall fiscal position in the short to medium term remains healthy. In the longer term, however, Government must seek to foster economic growth, and align the growth rates of government revenue and government expenditure."", '131.With per capita GDP at US$38,000, Hong Kong is now a mature economy. It is highly unlikely that the economy will grow at a rate of eight to nine per cent per annum as it did in the 1970s and 1980s. Over the past three decades, the annual real GDP growth averaged 4.6 per cent. The economic growth momentum is expected to slow down as our population ages, reducing our labour force. The Working Group projects that over the next 20 to 30 years nominal GDP will grow at an average rate of 4.4 per cent per annum; real GDP will grow at a trend rate of 2.8 per cent per annum, which is a notch higher than most other mature economies.', '132.The trend growth of government revenue has been on a par with nominal GDP growth over the past three decades. Assuming that the existing tax regime and tax rates were to remain unchanged, and barring any severe external shocks, the Working Group forecasts an average annual trend growth rate of 4.5 per cent for government revenue in the next 20 to 30 years. Towards the end of the projection period, government revenue is projected at 19.8 per cent of nominal GDP.', '133.The average annual growth rate of government expenditure since reunification is 4.7 per cent. Taking into account the economic growth trends and demographic changes, the Working Group has made the following three projections based on different expenditure growth scenarios –', '134.The projection results and analysis of the Working Group spark off a clear warning and call for serious attention. If government expenditure keeps growing and outpacing economic and revenue growth, a structural deficit would be inevitable.', '135.The Working Group recommends that Government should implement a combination of measures, including containing expenditure growth, preserving the revenue base and saving for future generations, to cope with the fiscal challenges ahead.', '136.We should neither take the problem lightly nor over worry. Our public finances are still in good shape. Our economy will continue to grow in the coming 20 to 30 years. This implies that our revenue will continue to rise and we can still afford expenditure increases. Nevertheless, the growth in public expenditure must be commensurate with that of the economy and government revenue. I believe that as long as we take timely, resolute and effective actions, we can prevent the projected results from surfacing, and avoid subjecting our future generations to irreversible fiscal plight.', ""(a)if no service enhancement were to be made to the three areas of education, social welfare and healthcare, such that their recurrent expenditure were to be adjusted only for demographic and price factors, government expenditure would grow by 5.3percent per annum during the projection period.Because the growth rate of government expenditure exceeds that of government revenue at 4.5percent per annum, a structural deficit would surface in 15 years' time;"", ""(b)if services were to be enhanced further for the three areas by one to twopercent per annum on top of adjustment for demographic and price factors, government expenditure would grow at an average of 6 to 6.7percent per annum.In that case, a structural deficit would surface in eight to ten years' time; and"", ""(c)if services were to be enhanced following the historical trends at about threepercent per annum for the three areas, on top of adjustments for demographic and price factors, government expenditure would grow at an average growth rate of 7.5percent per annum.In that case, a structural deficit would surface in seven years' time.""]"
378,2014,[Containing Expenditure Growth],"['137.The Working Group recommends that public expenditure be controlled at or around 20 per cent of GDP. It is a suitable level as it ensures that Government will not consume excessive social resources and that government expenditure will be kept at a level commensurate with government revenue. In fact, government revenue exceeded this level in only seven out of the past 40 financial years.', '138.It is incumbent upon Government to strictly contain the growth of expenditure. When preparing annual budgets, Government would hold fast to the forecast nominal GDP growth rates over the medium term as planning ceilings for total government expenditure. We should uphold fiscal disciplines, and put in place a more vigorous internal control and monitoring mechanism for assessing and prioritising competing funding priorities with appropriate offsettings from different programmes.', '139.Government departments and the public sector should conduct expenditure reviews and introduce efficiency measures with a view to doing more with less. In response to community needs, Government will continue to increase recurrent spending. But we must be wary that it is always easier to increase than to cut recurrent expenditure, and their cumulative financial impact cannot be ignored. All government departments should consider how best to consolidate their services and funding schemes, and phase out outdated and redundant items.']"
379,2014,[Preserving Revenue Base],"[""140.The second major recommendation of the Working Group is that Government should preserve, stabilise and broaden the revenue base. I am all for it. Having regard to the competitiveness of Hong Kong and the impact on the community, there is little room for major tax hikes. In principle, I shall not rule out any means to increase tax revenue. However, I also understand that it will be controversial to propose any new taxes, which need thorough consideration and public discussion. At the present stage, Government's priorities are to overcome the constraints posed by the ageing population on our economic growth, keep moving our economy up the value-added chain, and increase and preserve our revenue. Meanwhile, we have to ensure that our expenditure growth keeps pace with economic and revenue growth. We should also strive to forge a consensus in the community on preparing for Hong Kong's fiscal challenge in the short, medium and long term."", '141.To prevent revenue loss, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) will draw on international experience, step up tax enforcement and make better use of IT to combat tax evasion and avoidance, thereby recovering tax payable. The IRD has recovered over $14 billion in taxes over the past three years. We should preserve our indirect taxes such as rates and business registration fees, because they are broad-based and stable revenue sources.', ""142.Fees and charges is an important source of government revenue. Last year, I asked government departments to review their fees and charges, beginning with items which did not directly affect people's livelihood. After a review of more than 1 300 fees and charges, more than 200 increases have been proposed. These will reduce the loss of public revenue by around $60 million per year. We shall review other fees and charges this year, including water charges, which have not been revised for 19 years, the fees for use of leisure facilities and services, and charges relating to environmental hygiene services.""]"
380,2014,[Saving for the Future],"['143.Our fiscal reserves currently stand at over $700 billion. Of this amount, $220 billion is the balance of the Land Fund and $130 billion is held in funds with designated uses. Only the remaining $400 billion or so, held in the General Revenue Account, may be flexibly deployed to meet the day-to-day operation of Government. We can consider setting up a savings scheme to prepare for the future having regard to the experience of other economies. One example is the setting up of a ""Future Fund"" comprising the Land Fund and a portion of future surpluses. Government may draw on this contingency fund in the event of sustained budget deficit to finance strategic infrastructure projects conducive to Hong Kong\'s future economic development.', '144.An ageing population will pose sustained challenges to public finances. The conclusions and recommendations of the Working Group have provided a scientific and objective basis for the community to better understand the issues, and consider rational and pragmatic options ahead. We should take early action to address the challenges ahead when our public finances are still healthy. My colleagues and I shall examine the options in detail considering views from various sectors of the community, and take forward appropriate measures. I hope the experts and scholars in the Working Group will continue to tender their valuable advice to Government.']"
381,2014,[Relief Measures],"[""145.The Chief Executive has put forth in this year's Policy Address an array of measures to help the needy and the disadvantaged, and improve the livelihood of the grassroots.

I am aware of further requests seeking additional relief for the other sectors of the community, such as support for parents, children's education, self-advancement expenses, wage and rental expenses on the part of SMEs."", ""146.I am also aware that the public has expressed concern about Government's choice between recurrent and one-off relief measures. These measures serve different purposes. Recurrent measures may be deployed for new policies, new services or the enhancement of existing services. One-off relief measures, on the other hand, aim primarily at helping the public to cope with short-term financial pressure, or as a counter-cyclical measure to preserve economic stability and short-term employment. Unlike recurrent measures, one-off measures are necessarily subject to adjustment in the light of the economic and financial position of the year."", '147.When drawing up the one-off relief measures to be included in this Budget, I have taken into account the series of recurrent measures introduced by Government earlier to help the grassroots, the economic outlook for the next financial year, especially a slight slowdown in inflation, and the financial position in the current financial year. I now propose to launch five measures involving about $20 billion. Together with other measures in this Budget, the fiscal stimulus effect on GDP will be 0.7 percentage point. These five measures include –', ""148.In addition to one-off measures, I propose to increase the allowances for maintaining dependent parents or grandparents to alleviate taxpaying providers' burden. The three measures, which will benefit about 550 000 taxpayers and cost Government about $300 million a year, are –"", '(a)reducing salaries tax and tax under personal assessment for 2013-14 by 75percent, subject to a ceiling of $10,000.This proposal will benefit 1.74million taxpayers in the territory.The reduction will be reflected in the final tax payable for 2013-14.This will cost the Government about $9.2billion;', '(b)reducing profits tax for 2013-14 by 75percent, subject to a ceiling of $10,000.This proposal will benefit 126000 taxpayers in the territory.The reduction will be reflected in the final tax payable for 2013-14.This will cost Government about $1billion;', '(c)waiving rates for the first two quarters of 2014-15, subject to a ceiling of $1,500 per quarter for each rateable property.It is estimated to benefit around 3.1million properties, and will cost Government about $6.1billion;', ""(d)paying one month's rent for public housing tenants.Government will pay one month's base rent for tenants who are required to pay extra rent to the Housing Authority.For non-elderly tenants of the Hong Kong Housing Society's Group B estates, Government will pay two-thirds of their rent for one month.This measure will involve $1billion; and"", '(e)providing an extra allowance to Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) recipients, equal to one month of the standard rate CSSA payments, and an extra allowance to Old Age Allowance, Old Age Living Allowance and Disability Allowance recipients, equal to one month of the allowances.This will involve an additional expenditure of $2.7billion.', '(a)increasing the allowance for maintaining a dependent parent or grandparent aged 60 or above from $38,000 to $40,000.The same increase applies to the additional allowance for taxpayers residing with these parents or grandparents continuously throughout the year;', '(b)increasing the allowance for maintaining a dependent parent or grandparent aged between 55 and 59 from $19,000 to $20,000.The same increase applies to the additional allowance for taxpayers residing with these parents or grandparents continuously throughout the year; and', '(c)for taxpayers whose parents or grandparents are admitted to residential care homes, the deduction ceiling for elderly residential care expenses will be raised from the current $76,000 to $80,000.']"

I note that some members of the public are wary of any excessive growth in our spending and are worried that Hong Kong will be moving towards welfarism.  I understand their concern.  However, I would like to point out that Government's welfare spendings are meant to help the needy by providing them with short-term relief, so that those capable of working could re‑enter the labour market, make a living on their own, and leave the safety net as soon as possible.  I believe that so long as our society maintains adequate upward mobility channels and a level playing field, people will be able to improve their living through hard work.  Those who are in need today may be able to offer a helping hand and pay back to the community some day. 164.    We have seen examples of governments spending beyond their means in recent years in Europe and America.  This not only undermines the stability of a society but also gives rise to far-reaching consequences for the future.  The community's rising aspirations in an evolving environment will inevitably put increasing pressure on public finances. 165.    A philosopher once said, ""Society is a partnership.  It is a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born.""  Past generations have laid a solid foundation for economic and financial development in Hong Kong.  I believe that the present generation recognises the importance of fiscal prudence, that is to avoid making today's spending a burden for the next generation. 166.    We are faced with various challenges and choices.  Yet, I have full confidence in Hong Kong people.  Looking back, Hong Kong has gone through many tough times.  In the midst of these ups and downs, we survive the crises, breaking new grounds with our bare hands.  With confidence, we shall be able to meet the challenges that come our way. 167.    ""Believe in opportunity, not fate"" ― this is the innate mindset of Hong Kong people.  No matter what difficulties we face, we stay positive, optimistic and tenacious.  These unyielding qualities are deeply ingrained in us and form part of our collective DNA.

386,2010,[Introduction],"[ I move that the Appropriation Bill 2010 be read a second time.

Introduction

2.      This is my third Budget. In the past year, Hong Kong has gone through many ups and downs because of the adverse impact of the financial tsunami. The shocks to the global economy, in terms of their severity and scale, were more profound than those experienced during the Asian financial turmoil in 1997 and 1998.

3.      During the Asian financial turmoil, Asian currencies fluctuated wildly. Both the stock and property markets went down sharply. Nonetheless, the global economy still grew by 2.6 per cent and global trade expanded by 4.5 per cent in 1998. By contrast, the financial tsunami triggered by the US sub-prime mortgage problem has swept across the entire world. The global economy shrunk by one per cent and world trade plunged by 12 per cent. This recession is the most severe since World War II.

4.      In the face of this severe financial crisis, the Government implemented the strategy of “stabilising the financial system, supporting enterprises and preserving employment” in the shortest possible time. The measures we took included providing liquidity to banks, a full deposit guarantee for depositors, loan guarantee schemes with a guarantee commitment of $100 billion for small and medium enterprises, and fiscal stimulus, job creation and relief measures amounting to $87.6 billion. These measures provided impetus to our economy and restored people’s confidence.

5.      In the fourth quarter of 2009, our economy resumed positive growth after four consecutive quarters of year-on-year contraction – one quarter fewer than that during the Asian financial turmoil. At the worst part of this contraction, job losses were 43 000 – but that was only one-third of those experienced during the Asian financial turmoil. The unemployment rate during this economic contraction was also lower than that during the previous crisis, and started to fall as early as in the third quarter of last year.

6.      Although the current crisis is much more severe than the Asian financial turmoil, our economy has recovered more quickly this time. Both the job market and the overall economic performance indicate that our economic fundamentals are stronger than before and have shown greater resilience to withstand external shocks. The Government's timely strategy has yielded positive effects. More importantly, Hong Kong people have demonstrated once again their tenacity, confidence and ability to rise to challenges.

7.      While we have come through the most difficult period of the financial tsunami, the external environment is still fraught with uncertainties and the foundations of the recovery are not yet firm. I am also concerned that some people have yet to benefit from the economic recovery. Therefore, through this Budget, I will strive to achieve the three objectives of consolidating the recovery, developing our economy and building a caring society.

8.      In his Policy Address, the Chief Executive outlined the future socio-economic challenges and development directions for Hong Kong. I will seek to implement the development blueprint set out in the Policy Address through the proper allocation of resources. The expenditure and revenue proposals of Government departments and related organisations are detailed in the Estimates. I will elaborate on items about which the community are more concerned."
387,2010,[Economic Performance 2009],"['Economic Performance 2009', '9.First of all, I will say a few words about our economic performance in 2009 and the economic outlook for 2010.10.Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fell by 7.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2009.  But, as the Mainland economy returned to faster growth and the European and the US economies began to stabilise, our economy improved in the second quarter and resumed year-on-year growth of 2.6 per cent in the fourth quarter.  For 2009 as a whole, GDP fell by only 2.7 per cent.', '11.Amidst the severe plunge in global trade, Hong Kong’s goods exports fell by 12.6 per cent in real terms in 2009, the biggest annual drop on record.  For investment, gross domestic fixed capital formation dipped by 2.2 per cent for the whole year.  We can, however, take some comfort in the fact that consumer sentiment was not seriously affected for most of last year.  In 2009, private consumption expenditure dipped by only 0.3 per cent and actually reverted to a year-on-year increase in the latter half of the year.  Business sentiment also improved distinctly during the latter half of the year, with overall investment recording double-digit growth in the fourth quarter.12.Employment is the Government’s biggest concern.  As the economy started to recover and our measures to preserve employment proved effective, employment conditions turned better from the middle of last year, with unemployment rate coming down to 4.9 per cent lately.', '13.As the costs of doing business in Hong Kong came down and the average import prices softened as a result of the global recession, the inflation rate eased from the beginning of last year. Mild deflation was seen in the latter half of the year.  The average inflation rate for 2009 as measured by the Composite Consumer Price Index was 0.5 per cent.  Netting out the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate was one per cent. ', '| ']"
388,2010,[Economic Outlook 2010],"['Economic Outlook 2010', ""14.I am cautiously optimistic about Hong Kong's economic prospects for 2010.  The global economy has not yet regained its vigour.  There remain a number of uncertainties and potential pitfalls in the external environment.  While the European and the US economies have returned to positive growth, their labour markets have yet to improve and their financial systems are still impaired.  These economies may have undergone fundamental changes in their economic structures, and that will affect our future export performance. 15.It remains uncertain whether some of the economies can grow robustly after the effects of the huge stimulus measures have subsided.  If all countries and central banks were to exit from these measures at the same time, the potential shocks to the global financial and economic scenes would be a cause for concern.  Mounting protectionism is also being seen among countries.  These potential problems may put us on a bumpy recovery path in the year ahead.  As such, we have to remain vigilant against the risk of a possible relapse and prepare to maintain social and economic stability.16.On the other hand, the return to a stronger growth in the Mainland economy may help offset the fragile recovery in overseas markets.  I forecast GDP growth of four to five per cent for the year.  The employment situation is expected to improve further.  Deflation has been arrested, and mild inflation is expected to return this year.  I forecast that the underlying inflation rate for 2010 as a whole will average 1.5 per cent while the average rate of headline inflation will be 2.3 per cent.  I note that commodity prices have generally rebounded and that food prices in the Mainland have also risen.  If the US dollar exchange rate remains soft and these price increases continue, it will add to imported inflation especially in the latter part of the year which in turn may impose a heavier burden on Hong Kong people."", ' ', '| ', ' ']"
389,2010,[Challenges on the Road to Recovery],"['17.While our economy is in its early stage of recovery, the road ahead may not be smooth.  In the short term, we must carefully adjust the exceptional measures introduced to combat the financial tsunami and tackle the risk of asset-price bubbles.  In the medium to long term, we must endeavour to promote sustained and steady socio-economic development.', ' ', '| ', ' ']"
390,2010,[Adjusting Exceptional Measures],"['Adjusting Exceptional Measures', ""18.Since 2008, the Government has implemented a number of measures under the strategy of “stabilising the financial system, supporting enterprises and preserving employment”.  These exceptional measures were designed to counter the financial tsunami and would not be adopted lightly in normal circumstances.  They should not and cannot be sustained over a long period of time, lest they impose a heavy burden on public finances and undermine market operation.  Governments around the world are now making plans to exit from their exceptional measures.  Some have already begun to progressively execute these plans.  We should also prepare to adjust our exceptional measures at a suitable time.19.In respect of the support measures for enterprises, I announced in October 2009 that the application period for the Special Loan Guarantee Scheme would be extended to end-June 2010 to counter the credit crunch triggered by the global financial crisis.  So far, loans worth more than $68 billion have been approved by banks, benefiting over 16 000 enterprises and indirectly preserving jobs for 280 000 or so employees.  I will closely monitor the pace of our economic recovery over the next few months and consider when to let the credit market resume normal operation.20.On financial measures, the full deposit guarantee will remain in force until the end of this year.  At the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Finance Ministers' Meeting last year, I discussed the issue of exit strategies with finance ministers in the region.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has also established a tripartite working group with its counterparts in Singapore and Malaysia to work out suitable arrangements to exit from the deposit guarantee regimes.  The HKMA and I will continue to communicate and co-ordinate with the other governments, with the common objective of minimising the impact of exiting from the deposit guarantee on the economy and the banking system.  We have also completed a review on the existing Deposit Protection Scheme.  We will introduce a bill in the current legislative year to ensure that, upon expiry of the full deposit guarantee, the public can benefit from a more suitable protection scheme."", ' ', '| ', ' ']"
391,2010,[The Risk of Asset-Price Bubbles],"['The Risk of Asset-Price Bubbles', ""21.Since the onset of the financial tsunami, a number of economies have introduced expansionary fiscal measures and eased their monetary policies, resulting in a surge in global liquidity.  Large amounts of capital have been attracted into Asia, including Hong Kong, in a short period of time, stimulating investment activities in the asset markets.  Since the fourth quarter of 2008, the amount of inflow of funds has exceeded $640 billion, increasing the potential risk of creating asset-price bubbles.  We are also concerned that if capital flows were to reverse or interest rates rebound, asset prices would become more volatile.  This in turn may affect the stability of our financial system and the recovery of the real economy.22.The increased risk of a bubble forming in the property market has also aroused public concern about the difficulty in buying homes.  The inflow of funds has fuelled an increase in the prices of luxury flats, which to some extent has affected the prices of small and medium-sized flats.  This, together with a relatively low supply of flats in the past two years, has led some people to worry that their plans to buy a home may be frustrated.  However, there are also suggestions that the Government should act prudently to prevent public policies from causing wild fluctuations in property prices.  Hong Kong's residential property market is extremely sensitive.  Any such fluctuations in property prices would have a profound impact on the economy, on hundreds of thousands of flat owners and on the public.23.The Government is closely monitoring the situation in the property market.  In January this year, the prices of some luxury flats returned to the peaks of the 1997 property boom, while prices of small and medium-sized flats were about 23 per cent lower.  Overall, property prices are eight per cent above their peaks before the financial tsunami.  On average, the ratio of mortgage payment to household income in the current low-interest rate environment is reasonably healthy.  According to figures from the fourth quarter of last year, the ratio of mortgage payment to median household income is around 38 per cent for a 20-year mortgage on a flat with a saleable area of 45 square metres. This is lower than the average of 53 per cent in the past 20 years.24.While the local property market is still reasonably healthy, we must not lose sight of the increasing risk of a property bubble developing with the global economic recovery and the abundant liquidity in the international financial markets.  The rise in property prices has picked up again after a slight moderation in the fourth quarter of last year, and turnover also increased.  I am particularly concerned that some citizens may no longer afford their mortgage payments if the interest rates were to reverse to a more normal level.  To ensure a healthy and stable development of the property market, we will implement measures in the following four aspects.25.Our first set of measures will address the fundamental issue of flat supply.  Over the past few months, real estate developers have been more active in applying for sale of sites on the Application List, lease modifications and land exchanges.  In response to the Government's request, the MTR Corporation Limited (MTR Corporation) and the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) have also quickened the pace of bringing residential sites to the market to increase the supply of flats in the coming few years.  In 2010, the number of private residential units completed will increase to 14 300.  In the coming three to four years, we estimate that about 53 000 private residential units will come onto the market.  To further increase the supply of flats, we will introduce the following measures.26.While we believe that the Government should maintain the market-driven Application List system as its principal mechanism for the sale of government land, improvement measures should be implemented to increase residential land supply.  In this connection, the Government has drawn up the Application List for 2010-11 for application by the market. However, depending on market conditions, the Government will put up several urban residential sites in the List for sale by auction or tender in the coming two years if they have not been triggered.27.In addition, we will liaise with the MTR Corporation and the URA to increase the supply of small and medium-sized residential flats in their West Rail property development projects and urban renewal projects respectively.  We are also preparing to sell by open tender a site of about 1.2 hectares near the West Rail Long Ping Station in Yuen Long for private residential purpose, and will increase the supply of small and medium-sized flats by specifying in the land sale conditions requirements in terms of the minimum number of flats and the range of size of such units. The Secretary for Development will elaborate on these improvement measures when announcing the Application List for 2010-11.28.At present, there are more than 300 000 Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats.  Over 60 000 are flats with premium paid and 250 000 or so are flats with premium not yet paid, and the two categories of flats can be put on sale in the open market and the HOS secondary market respectively.  Mostly priced below $2 million and situated in various districts of the territory, HOS flats can cater for the medium and low-priced property market.  The Hong Kong Housing Authority will actively explore means to revitalise the HOS secondary market.29.Second, we will increase the transaction cost of property speculation with appropriate tax measures so as to reduce the risk of creating a property bubble.  I propose that with effect from 1 April this year the rate of stamp duty on transactions of properties valued more than $20 million be increased from 3.75 per cent to 4.25 per cent, and buyers will no longer be allowed to defer payment of stamp duty on such transactions.  In parallel, we will closely monitor the trading of properties valued at or below $20 million.  If there is excessive speculation in the trading of these properties, we will consider extending the measures to these transactions.30.The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) has established procedures to track property transactions involving speculation and will follow up each case closely.  If it is found that such transactions constitute a business, the IRD will levy profits tax on the persons or companies concerned for profits arising from such transactions.31.Third, we will ensure transparency in property transactions and transaction prices to facilitate effective operation of the market.  The Chief Executive announced in November 2009 three measures including shortening the lead time for developers to make public details of transactions, and requiring developers to list the price per square foot in saleable area of individual flats and adopt a reasonable floor numbering system.  We will work to uphold fairness in market operation to ensure that both buyers and sellers can conduct informed transactions.  We will not tolerate market players disseminating confusing information in an attempt to manipulate the market.  I have asked the Secretary for Transport and Housing to enhance the regulation of property transactions to ensure that citizens can buy and sell properties in a fair and transparent market.  The Bureau is now exploring further measures to strengthen the regulation of the sale of first-hand, uncompleted private residential flats.32.Fourth, we will strive to prevent excessive expansion in mortgage lending so as to avert fuelling an asset-price bubble in the property market.  Last October the HKMA issued guidelines to banks, lowering the loan-to-value ratio for mortgages on properties valued at $20 million or above and requiring banks to process mortgage loan applications prudently.  I have asked the HKMA to closely monitor the situation and take further measures when necessary to strengthen the prudent regulation of banks.33.It is the policy objective of the Government to ensure a healthy and stable development of the property market.  The above measures strike a balance between reducing the risk of a property bubble and preventing public policies from causing unnecessary fluctuations in the property market.  It is very important to maintain this balance particularly at this point in time, in the face of uncertainties in the external environment.  The Government and the regulatory bodies will continue to closely monitor the situation and take further measures when necessary."", ' ', '| ', ' ']"

These include maintaining the rule of law and a simple and low tax regime, nurturing talent, investing in infrastructure, and helping enterprises tap markets outside Hong Kong.37.While acknowledging the importance of market mechanism, the Government will not be completely passive in regards to the adjustment of the economy and the allocation of resources.  Where necessary, the Government will introduce measures to safeguard social stability and sustain the normal operation of the economy in the face of fluctuations in a fast-changing economic environment.38.During an economic downturn, some people are trapped in difficulties for various reasons.  Therefore, the Government adopted a pragmatic and flexible approach and introduced expansionary measures during the financial crisis to stabilise the economy and safeguard the livelihood of our people.  When our economy is in the early stage of recovery, it is still necessary for the Government to take measures to help those who have not benefited immediately from the recovery or adapted themselves to the new economic environment.

394,2010,[Ensuring Adequate Fiscal Reserves],"['Ensuring Adequate Fiscal Reserves', ""39.Our quick recovery from the financial tsunami is, to some extent, attributable to the Government's prompt deployment of huge fiscal resources to stabilise the economy.  The intensity of several rounds of stimulus measures introduced since 2008 and involving a total of $87.6 billion is unprecedented.  This clearly demonstrates that maintaining adequate fiscal reserves is a prerequisite for the Government to fulfil the functions of ensuring social and economic stability.40.Government revenue is highly susceptible to economic fluctuations.  Flexibility in expenditure is very low.  Over the years we have adopted the strategy of containing expenditure prudently and using our fiscal reserves as a buffer for deficits in individual years.  As such, we are able to achieve a fiscal balance and keep expenditure within the limits of revenues over a period of time.  The reserves required for the buffer can be substantial.  Take the six years starting from 1998-99 as an example.  The five fiscal deficits that occurred in these years reduced our fiscal reserves by about $200 billion – the equivalent of 40 per cent of our fiscal reserves as at end-March 1998.41.Apart from providing a buffer, the fiscal reserves also generate revenue of tens of billions of dollars each year.  In 2009-10, for example, investment income accounted for 11 per cent of total government revenue.  Should the reserves continue to fall, the revenue from this source will drop accordingly. This will reduce the resources available for investing in projects to build our economy and improve people's livelihood.42.Where necessary, I will draw on the fiscal reserves to implement measures for economic and social stability.  However, I must act with prudence and replenish our reserves as and when appropriate.  After the financial tsunami, we should appreciate more deeply the importance of adequate fiscal reserves.  In the long run, an ageing population and a shrinking working population will further narrow our tax base. More than ever, we need to prepare for the future by increasing our reserves to meet these challenges."", ' ', '| ', ' ']"

At the international level, the Mainland has been actively promoting quality growth and encouraging enterprises to reach out to the international market.  Hong Kong can provide a platform for the Mainland's enterprises to expand overseas.  We can also make use of our strengths to help these enterprises bring their management and technological standards closer to the international level.  With our rich experience in international exchanges, we can assist the Mainland in building brand names and improving product image.  Our service industries will emerge out of the process with broader scope and better standards.  Our position as an international financial and commercial centre will also be reinforced.47.At the national level, the Mainland economy is becoming more and more market-oriented, industrialised and urbanised.  This plays a crucial role in China's sustainable development and creates excellent opportunities for Hong Kong.  Hong Kong can assist by attracting foreign investment, facilitating international exchanges and providing quality services that are essential to the restructuring and upgrading of Mainland's economy.  This will help promote quality growth of the Mainland's economy.  It will also increase the demand for Hong Kong services, thereby addressing the problem of our small local market.48.At the regional level, Guangdong is one of the best developed regions in China.  It is also the vanguard of our country's reform and liberalisation, and its systems can most readily be aligned with international standards.  Hong Kong and Guangdong enjoy geographical proximity, close cultural ties and a long history of co-operation, and yet differ greatly in such areas as resources and industrial structure.  As such, there is ample room for the two places to increase co-operation.

The works for the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link project also started in January this year.', '56.The estimated capital works expenditure for 2010-11 will increase to $49.6 billion.

Currently, the Construction Industry Council (CIC) strives to attract more people, especially young people, to join the construction industry through training and trade testing.  Furthermore, the CIC aims to enhance the skills and competitiveness of in-service construction workers and to uplift the image of the industry through promotion and public education.  Together with the industry, we will take the lead to introduce best practices in public works projects to further improve the safety, working environment and conditions in construction sites.  I will also earmark $100 million to support the CIC to strengthen the relevant work, and I expect that the CIC will increase its investment in tandem with this funding to provide the necessary incentives to attract more young people to join the construction industry and to improve the practice of the industry.

Arrangements for non-Guangdong residents living in Shenzhen to apply for individual visit endorsements in Shenzhen were also implemented last December.82.We hope that these measures to help Shenzhen residents visit Hong Kong can be extended to cover more cities in the PRD region, and eventually all of Guangdong Province.  As there are about 83 million permanent residents in Guangdong, the extension of these measures, if implemented, will bring considerable benefit to our tourism, retail and the related industries.83.We will also develop new travel themes and products to attract returning visitors.  More than $25 million of funds in sponsorship of six arts, cultural and sports events held in Hong Kong has been approved so far under the Mega Events Fund unveiled last year.

The study recommends that the Government should target limited public resources at providing subsidised residential care services to the elderly most in need, and further develop community care services to help the elderly age in place.139.We agree with the general direction of ""ageing in place"" advocated in the study report, which is in line with the Government\'s policy of ""supporting ageing in the community as the core, institutional care as back-up"".  In tandem with the Elderly Commission\'s study on community care services, we will launch an elderly home care pilot scheme to provide more personalised home care services for the elderly who are waiting for nursing home places.  I have earmarked $55 million under the Lotteries Fund to implement this pilot scheme in Kowloon.  The Social Welfare Department will invite organisations with experience in elderly services to submit expressions of interest setting out their proposals on the service content and the modes of service delivery.140.The Government will also increase recurrent funding by about $9 million to provide 115 additional subsidised day care places for the elderly, and provide additional funding of about $4 million to extend the District-based Scheme on Carer Training.  These measures will help provide support to elderly people ageing at home.                |  ', '| ', ' ']"

About $60 million will be used to provide 268 additional subvented residential care places for persons with disabilities, 154 additional places for pre-school rehabilitation services and 260 additional places for day training and vocational rehabilitation services.  About $40 million will be used to strengthen such support services as physiotherapy and nursing care for elderly residents in subvented residential care homes for persons with intellectual disability.  I will also provide additional funding of about $8 million to increase the number of Rehabuses to 119 by acquiring four new buses and replacing six old ones.142.We will regulate the residential care homes for persons with disabilities through a statutory licensing scheme.  Before the scheme is launched, we will introduce complementary measures to encourage operators of private residential care homes to improve their service quality, increase the provision of subsidised residential care places, and facilitate the market to develop residential care homes of different types and modes of operation.  I have earmarked $64 million under the Lotteries Fund to implement a pilot Bought Place Scheme for residential care homes for persons with disabilities.  The Social Welfare Department will finalise the operational details of the scheme as soon as possible.                        143.Moreover, I will earmark $163 million under the Lotteries Fund to implement a pilot scheme to provide persons with severe disabilities with home-based nursing care services, with a view to strengthening the community support to persons with disabilities and relieving the pressure on their family carers.

Employment provides a source of steady income and protection for individuals and families.  It is a key to social stability.  Therefore, I have been paying great attention to the employment issue and adopting a two-pronged approach.  First is promoting economic development.  Only when the economy grows robustly can more employment opportunities be created.  Second is providing suitable employment support and training to increase the competitiveness and employment motivation of job seekers so they can seize these opportunities.  I will therefore provide additional funding of $173 million to implement the following measures to support job seekers.148.The Labour Department will launch a two-year ""Pilot Employment Navigator Programme"".  Under this programme, a cash incentive of $5,000 will be payable to each person who has worked for a continuous period of three months after receiving the department\'s intensive employment counselling and job matching services.  The programme will provide 11 000 places a year.  It is designed to address the problem of manpower mismatch, fully utilise our labour productivity and encourage employment.149.We will step up our efforts to help young people with special employment difficulties.  The Labour Department will launch a targeted employment programme under which non-governmental organisations will provide training and internship for 12 months to young people, aged between 15 and 24 with low educational qualifications, who need special assistance because of emotional and behavioural problems or learning difficulties.  The programme will provide 500 places.150.In my last Budget I provided additional funding of over $400 million for the Labour Department to strengthen its various employment and training services.  These services will continue to benefit job seekers in 2010-11.151.During the Budget consultation period, there were many suggestions to extend the Transport Support Scheme, which aims at encouraging needy job seekers living in remote districts where job opportunities are fewer to ""go out"" and seek jobs or work across districts.  The Labour and Welfare Bureau will complete by the end of this year a study on ways to reduce the burden of travelling expenses borne by the working poor in Hong Kong.

During the Budget consultation period, many people suggested that we should introduce short-term measures to alleviate people's burdens.

This will rise to nearly $110 billion with this year's measures.  Such measures, introduced on top of the current expenditure on health, housing, education and social welfare, are effective in stimulating the economy and safeguarding social stability and people's livelihood during the exceptional times of the financial tsunami.  However, I must stress that these exceptional means employed at exceptional times cannot continue for long.  Otherwise, they will affect the health of our public finances and dampen the enthusiasm for economic progress.  I hope that these temporary measures will help our citizens tide over their present difficulties, assist our economy to regain its footing, and safeguard people's livelihood.""]"

However, the economy showed signs of gradual improvement from the second quarter of 2009, leading to better-than-expected revenues.  The huge inflow of funds resulting from the global low-interest environment and the quantitative easing policy adopted by the many countries has given rise to hectic trading in both the stock and the property markets.  As a result, revenue from stamp duties reaches $40.5 billion, which is higher than the original estimate by $15.5 billion.  The revised estimate for operating revenue is $255 billion.  The revised estimate for land revenue is $37.3 billion, more than double the original estimate.  The revised total revenue is $308.5 billion, $46.8 billion higher than the original estimate.157.The revised estimate for operating expenditure is $236 billion, slightly lower than the original estimate.  With a number of public works projects entering their construction peaks, capital expenditure is expected to reach $55.2 billion, and total expenditure will be $291.2 billion.158.Overall, I forecast a surplus of $19 billion in the Operating Account for 2009-10.  For the Consolidated Account, after repayment of government bonds, I forecast a surplus of $13.8 billion, equivalent to 0.8 per cent of our GDP.

447,2010,[Concluding Remarks],"['165.Mr President, the first decade of the 21st century is just behind us.  The decade has seen several crises.  We have come to realise the speed at which the global economic landscape is changing.  Some worry that Hong Kong may be marginalised amidst the intense economic competition in the region and lag behind in the process of globalisation.  The successive crises have put many citizens under tremendous pressure.  They argue that the mode of our economic development cannot achieve a fair distribution of wealth, thus causing problems of poverty and social immobility.  Some people also query, from a values perspective, the suitability to Hong Kong of the mode of promoting economic growth through infrastructural development.166.As Hong Kong is a small and open economy subject to external constraints, it is inappropriate for us to solve the unemployment and poverty problems through large-scale redistribution of wealth.  If we adopt this approach, which focuses on providing high levels of welfare, we will have to overhaul our tax regime and tax rates, weaken wage elasticity and adjustment function of the market, and fundamentally change our well-established mode of economic operation.  I don\'t believe this will be acceptable to our society at large.  I believe that in the long run, the fundamental solution to the problems of unemployment and poverty is to promote overall economic growth so as to provide opportunities for wealth creation in the community.167.We uphold the principle of ""Big Market, Small Government"" because we believe that the market mechanism is the most effective way to raise economic efficiency.  However, the Government will intervene when the market is not functioning properly.  Our investment in education, infrastructure and social welfare aims to enhance overall competitiveness and to upgrade the capabilities of our citizens so they can rise to social and economic changes, which will in turn enhance social mobility.168.Our long-term strategy for poverty alleviation is to develop the economy and invest in education.  Between 2004 and 2008, when our economy was on an upturn, the number of low-income earners decreased.  Income levels generally improved.  Unemployment and underemployment rates fell.  These show that the grassroots can also benefit from an economic boom.  However, we also notice that in times of economic downturn, they bear the brunt of income reduction.  Therefore, since 2008 we have introduced various short-term relief measures to help them meet their pressing needs.169.Expenditure on education now takes up the largest share of recurrent government expenditure.  Expenditure in this area has increased substantially over the past decade.  This is because we believe that education and training are fundamental to enhancing social mobility.  Quality human capital is the key to building a knowledge-based economy.  Education plays a crucial role in personal development.  An educator once said: ""Education then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the greatest equaliser of the conditions of men － the balance-wheel of the social machinery.""  Many success stories in Hong Kong have one common lesson － knowledge changes one\'s fate.  I believe that continuous investment in education will yield continuous and improving returns for the community at large.170.The context in which our public policies are framed has become complicated in recent years.  Our citizens, with very high expectations of the Government, hope we can solve all problems in the shortest possible time.  But some are concerned about over-expansion of the Government.  I believe that the most important element in the relationship between the Government and the market, and between the economy and the community is to ensure an efficient government.  An efficient government spends public money cost-effectively, uses public resources to promote our economic development and restructuring, promotes social advancement and improves our citizens\' quality of life.  Apart from a ""big market"" and a ""small government"", we have a dynamic ""big community"".  We should make good use of our abundant social capital, and join hands to tackle social problems and pursue social justice and values.171.In my view, a government upholding market principles is by no means a ruthless government.  We promote economic development to benefit the community at large and not just a handful of rich people.  When confronted with the poverty problem, the whole community has the collective responsibility to tackle it.  The Government provides a favourable and vibrant market environment and economic setting for the business sector to play to their strengths.  When some people cannot benefit from this, we expect that the business sector will fulfil their social responsibility to build a caring society together.172.We have been stressing the importance of economic development because we believe that a prosperous society is in the overall interests of Hong Kong.  In promoting economic development, we are serving the interests of all sectors of the community and not individual classes.  I believe that Hong Kong people love to live in a prosperous society, and in a prosperous and caring society even more.173.I share people\'s deep anxiety about layoffs and pay cuts.  Since reunification, the Asian financial crisis and the financial tsunami have brought hardship to our people.  We have in response introduced a number of measures to improve the employment situation, thereby improving people\'s livelihood.  In addition, we also introduced relief measures to alleviate their burden, even though this might cause a deficit for the time being.  In the long run, we must maintain fiscal discipline to ensure that our children will not be burdened by our spending today.  I believe this is what a responsible government should do.174.The contributing factors in Hong Kong\'s poverty problem are many.  They include the outward mobility of Hong Kong people, the socio-economic conditions of the migrant population, and structural changes of the local economy.  There has been considerable discussion in the community on ways to alleviate poverty.  Much remains to be done.  Legislating for a statutory minimum wage, promoting employment and implementing relief measures are our priority tasks.  When the community has reached a consensus on the relevant policies, we will provide the necessary financial resources.175.We have been taking a pragmatic approach to economic development.  Economic pragmatism has tided us over many difficult times in the past.  In promoting economic growth, we will take into account changes in the external environment as well as the situation of Hong Kong.  We will have regard to the prevailing circumstances, without rigidly adhering to any single ideology or dogma.  These are basic ingredients of Hong Kong\'s sustainable development.  As such, while we are the freest economy in the world, we are also reputed to be the biggest public housing provider.  I am always prepared to introduce initiatives that are pragmatic, proactive and conducive to the overall development of our city.176.Recent events in Hong Kong have shown that some citizens attach importance to the values underlying social development.  I appreciate that different people hold different values and that this is perfectly normal in an open and diversified society.  In implementing public policies, the Government listens to the views of people with different values, and takes into account the actual needs of the community.  For example, while showing respect for conservation and local values, we should carefully consider the role that development plays in promoting economic growth and increasing job opportunities.  In balancing different values and handling conflicts in the community, we should tread lightly on the differences by giving due consideration to all views.177.Mr President, Hong Kong has been through many changes in the past century.  Politically, Hong Kong, formerly a British colony, was reunited with China as a Special Administrative Region with a high degree of autonomy.  Economically, Hong Kong has been transformed from a local city engaged in manufacturing industries into a world city orientated to financial and service industries.  It has also changed from an immigrant city to a civil society.  We all love living here and have a strong sense of identity as Hong Kong people.  It is a delight to see that citizens are attaching great value to their identity.  I believe that as long as we maintain close communication with various sectors of the community and our policies can serve the interests of our people, Hong Kong will be able to sustain its economic and social development. 178.Hong Kong people have gone through many tough times before.  In confronting crises and difficulties, we have displayed unity and solidarity.  So long as we strive to enhance social cohesion and keep up the Hong Kong spirit, I have full confidence in the future of Hong Kong. |  ', ' ', '| ', ' ', '165.Mr President, the first decade of the 21st century is just behind us.  The decade has seen several crises.  We have come to realise the speed at which the global economic landscape is changing.  Some worry that Hong Kong may be marginalised amidst the intense economic competition in the region and lag behind in the process of globalisation.  The successive crises have put many citizens under tremendous pressure.  They argue that the mode of our economic development cannot achieve a fair distribution of wealth, thus causing problems of poverty and social immobility.  Some people also query, from a values perspective, the suitability to Hong Kong of the mode of promoting economic growth through infrastructural development.166.As Hong Kong is a small and open economy subject to external constraints, it is inappropriate for us to solve the unemployment and poverty problems through large-scale redistribution of wealth.  If we adopt this approach, which focuses on providing high levels of welfare, we will have to overhaul our tax regime and tax rates, weaken wage elasticity and adjustment function of the market, and fundamentally change our well-established mode of economic operation.  I don\'t believe this will be acceptable to our society at large.  I believe that in the long run, the fundamental solution to the problems of unemployment and poverty is to promote overall economic growth so as to provide opportunities for wealth creation in the community.167.We uphold the principle of ""Big Market, Small Government"" because we believe that the market mechanism is the most effective way to raise economic efficiency.  However, the Government will intervene when the market is not functioning properly.  Our investment in education, infrastructure and social welfare aims to enhance overall competitiveness and to upgrade the capabilities of our citizens so they can rise to social and economic changes, which will in turn enhance social mobility.168.Our long-term strategy for poverty alleviation is to develop the economy and invest in education.  Between 2004 and 2008, when our economy was on an upturn, the number of low-income earners decreased.  Income levels generally improved.  Unemployment and underemployment rates fell.  These show that the grassroots can also benefit from an economic boom.  However, we also notice that in times of economic downturn, they bear the brunt of income reduction.  Therefore, since 2008 we have introduced various short-term relief measures to help them meet their pressing needs.169.Expenditure on education now takes up the largest share of recurrent government expenditure.  Expenditure in this area has increased substantially over the past decade.  This is because we believe that education and training are fundamental to enhancing social mobility.  Quality human capital is the key to building a knowledge-based economy.  Education plays a crucial role in personal development.  An educator once said: ""Education then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the greatest equaliser of the conditions of men － the balance-wheel of the social machinery.""  Many success stories in Hong Kong have one common lesson － knowledge changes one\'s fate.  I believe that continuous investment in education will yield continuous and improving returns for the community at large.170.The context in which our public policies are framed has become complicated in recent years.  Our citizens, with very high expectations of the Government, hope we can solve all problems in the shortest possible time.  But some are concerned about over-expansion of the Government.  I believe that the most important element in the relationship between the Government and the market, and between the economy and the community is to ensure an efficient government.  An efficient government spends public money cost-effectively, uses public resources to promote our economic development and restructuring, promotes social advancement and improves our citizens\' quality of life.  Apart from a ""big market"" and a ""small government"", we have a dynamic ""big community"".  We should make good use of our abundant social capital, and join hands to tackle social problems and pursue social justice and values.171.In my view, a government upholding market principles is by no means a ruthless government.  We promote economic development to benefit the community at large and not just a handful of rich people.  When confronted with the poverty problem, the whole community has the collective responsibility to tackle it.  The Government provides a favourable and vibrant market environment and economic setting for the business sector to play to their strengths.

448,2021,Introduction,"['Mr President, Honourable Members and fellowcitizens,', 'I move that the Appropriation Bill 2021 be read a second time.', 'Introduction', '2.Over the past year, we all have experienced a very different life. The epidemic has aggravated the economic recession. Face masks have become a daily necessity. We might have spent more time at home, but we have fewer opportunities to gather with our relatives and friends. The year 2020 has become our common memory.', '3.The epidemic has made us realise that globalisation is not only a driving force for economic development, but also the key to victory in the fight against viruses and epidemics. No place on earth can stay aloof and remain unaffected. Only with concerted efforts can we successfully beat this pandemic of the century that has plagued the entire world.', ""4.Hong Kong went through tribulations in the past two years. International political tensions have dampened local exports and market sentiments; violent clashes have endangered the stability and safety of our society; and the epidemic has exerted additional pressure on the whole community and economy. In the past year, Hong Kong's economy recorded a negative growth of 6.1 per cent with the latest unemployment rate rising to seven per cent. The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has committed a total of nearly $300 billion for supporting measures, with a view to stabilising the economy and relieving people's burden. However, this has also brought the fiscal deficit to a record high."", '5.With the epidemic still lingering, our economy is yet to come out of recession. Our most urgent task is to contain the epidemic and press ahead with the vaccination programme, so that people and businesses can be back on track, and safe travelling between Hong Kong and the Mainland as well as the rest of the world can be resumed as soon as possible. I will, as always, provide the resources required to fully support the anti-epidemic work.', ""6.This year's Budget focuses on stabilising the economy and relieving people's burden. It aims to alleviate the hardship and pressure caused by the economic downturn and the epidemic through the introduction of counter-cyclical measures costing over $120 billion; and seeks to create a leverage effect to benefit our people, workers as well as enterprises. It is equally important that we should grasp the major directions and new trends of future development to strategically enhance our policy steering, support measures and resources allocation in key areas. This will not only bring new impetus to our industries, but also enable them to have a more dynamic, diverse and interactive development. I will go into more details in the ensuing paragraphs.""]"
449,2021,Economic Situation in 2020,"['EconomicSituation in 2020', ""7.Last year, the COVID‑19 pandemic ravaged the world, causing unprecedented repercussions on the global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that the global economy contracted significantly by 3.5 per cent for the year as a whole. At the onset of the outbreak, governments around the world implemented stringent social distancing requirements and widespread lockdowns, plunging many major economies into a deep recession in the first half of last year. Amid a sharp fall in external demand caused by the epidemic, Hong Kong's total exports of goods tumbled by 9.7 per cent year-on-year in real terms in the first quarter of last year. Later, with a strong rebound in the Mainland economy after its epidemic situation was kept under control and the gradual recovery of other major economies in the second half of the year, Hong Kong's total exports of goods resumed growth in the second half of the year. Yet, there was still a mild decrease of 0.3 per cent for the year as a whole."", '8.Under the threat of the epidemic, inbound tourism was brought to a frozen state for most of the time last year amid extensive travel restrictions worldwide. Exports of travel services fell drastically by 90.5 per cent for the year as a whole. Exports of financial services saw a moderate growth in the period, but total exports of services still registered a record decline of 36.8 per cent for the year as a whole. ', '9.Given the volatile local epidemic situation, social distancing measures were tightened from time to time. This, coupled with the weak job and income conditions, has dampened local consumer sentiments. Private consumption expenditure dropped significantly by 10.1 per cent for the year as a whole despite some narrowing of the decline in the second half of the year. Amid the highly uncertain business outlook, investment expenditure fell by 11.5 per cent.', ""10.Hong Kong's overall economy contracted substantially by nine per cent in the first half of last year. While a slight improvement was seen in the third quarter, it has been hit again by the epidemic since the latter part of the fourth quarter. For 2020 as a whole, the economy contracted by 6.1 per cent, the largest annual decline on record. It is also the first time for Hong Kong to register two consecutive years of negative growth."", '11.The labour market deteriorated sharply. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate went up from 3.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019 to seven per cent in the latest period, the highest in close to 17 years. Amid the epidemic, the consumption- and tourism-related sectors were hit hard. The unemployment rate of the retail, accommodation and food services sectors combined rose to 11.3 per cent. In particular, the unemployment rate of the food and beverage services sector reached a high level of 14.7 per cent. The unemployment rate of the construction sector also reached a double- digit level. Household incomes fell markedly in the year.', ""12.Amid a lacklustre economy, pressures on consumer price inflation were modest. Netting out the effects of the Government's one-off measures, the underlying inflation rate was 1.3 per cent for last year as a whole, down 1.7 percentage point from the year before."", '13.As for the property market, the residential property market was generally stable last year. Prices of commercial and industrial properties fell visibly from their peak in 2019, and transaction volume dropped to a record low. Following the relaxation of macro- prudential measures for mortgage loans on non-residential properties by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), as well as the abolition of the Doubled Ad Valorem Stamp Duty on non- residential property transactions by the Government, there was a slight rebound in transactions in the latter part of last year.

450,2021,Economic Outlook for 2021 and Medium-term Outlook,"['EconomicOutlook for 2021 and Medium-term Outlook', '14.With the launch of vaccination schemes in various places around the world, the global economy may see relatively significant improvements starting from the latter half of 2021. Last month, the IMF forecast that the global economy will rebound by 5.5 per cent this year.', '15.The Mainland economy was hard hit by the epidemic in early 2020. Nevertheless, with the epidemic swiftly put under control and vigorous macro policies implemented in a timely manner, the Mainland economy experienced a strong rebound since the second quarter with an annual growth of 2.3 per cent, making our country the only major economy in the world that achieved a positive growth. Looking ahead, though there are still uncertainties arising from the global epidemic situation and the China-US relations, the Mainland economy is fundamentally sound. The Central Economic Work Conference held at the end of last year emphasised that the continuity, stability and sustainability of the macro policies would be maintained to provide the necessary support for economic recovery on an ongoing basis. All these would be conducive to robust economic growth in the Mainland.', '16.The US economy has begun to pick up since the third quarter of last year. With the rollout of a vaccination programme and the support of fiscal stimulus measures, as well as the easy monetary environment, market forecasts generally point to faster economic growth in the US this year. The economy in Europe has slowed down again recently due to the resurgence of the pandemic. Nevertheless, with stronger policy support provided by the European Central Bank since late last year, the eurozone economy is expected to rebound later this year, provided that vaccines are widely applied. Once the epidemic is contained, Japan and other economies in Asia will also see a visible recovery this year.', '17.The foreign and economic policy directions of the US administration is the attention of the whole world. Their implications on the China-US relations and their economies are of particular significance. The global community hopes that China-US economic and trade relations can gradually be back to normal, thereby supporting further revival of global trade and business activities. However, as seen from the developments in the past few years, there remain many deep-seated conflicts between the two nations. Looking ahead, relations between the two nations will remain in a state of continued tensions, and on-going competition but without a total break-down. Changes in China-US relations will affect the global trade, finance and political landscape. External factors such as geopolitical situations and possible financial risks associated with the surging global public debt also warrant attention.', ""18.Hong Kong's economy is expected to resume positive growth this year, but the progress of economic recovery will hinge on the development of the epidemic. As cross-boundary movement of people and tourism activities take time to resume normal, the economy will still face significant challenges in the first half of the year. Nevertheless, as long as the community gather together to control the epidemic and social stability is maintained, economic recovery will likely gain a stronger momentum in the second half of the year in tandem with an expected rebound in the global economy. Having regard to the latest internal and external situations as well as the stimulus effect of the fiscal measures, I forecast that our economy will grow by 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent in real terms this year."", '19.On inflation, external price pressures are expected to remain modest. After two consecutive years of contraction, overall economic activities will remain below the pre-recession level this year and should not pose notable pressure on local costs. I forecast that the headline inflation rate and the underlying inflation rate will be 1.6 per cent and one per cent respectively this year.', '20.In the medium term, Hong Kong will continue to benefit from the ongoing development of the Mainland and the shift in global economic gravity from West to East. The economic outlook is positive. Our country\'s economy will continue to advance during the 14th Five‑Year Plan period. The signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement will further promote economic integration in the region.

On the other hand, the Government will strive to overcome land and talent constraints, promote innovation and technology (I&T) development, invest in education and nurture talent, and strengthen connection with the world.

The ageing population also poses pressure on public expenditure. Though I have great confidence in Hong Kong's fundamental strengths and long-term prospects, we must, in the face of an economic downturn and the aforesaid challenges, exercise extra prudence in managing public finance."", ""165.Our fiscal reserves are the fruits of the economic development of Hong Kong and the hard work of our people over the years. They enable us to adopt a deficit budget amid the prevailing economic downturn and launch counter-cyclical measures to support the economy and relieve people's burden. In the past year, we have increased government expenditure substantially to combat the epidemic and roll out relief measures, which resulted in our fiscal reserves dropping sharply in two years from the equivalent of 23 months of government expenditure to 13 months."", '166.Although I forecast an improvement in revenue for the next financial year, I expect that the fiscal deficit will be $101.6 billion, accounting for 3.6 per cent of GDP, due to the counter-cyclical fiscal measures and the continued increase in recurrent expenditure. In other words, Hong Kong will record a deficit for a number of years after achieving a surplus for 15 years. As shown in the Medium Range Forecast (MRF), the Operating Account is projected to be in deficit for five consecutive years. The operating deficit for 2021-22 will be more than $140 billion mainly due to the counter-cyclical measures while the operating deficit for the remaining four years will range from $22.4 billion to $40.7 billion. The Consolidated Account is also expected to record a deficit for four consecutive years. The above forecast has not yet taken into account any tax rebate or relief measure that the Government may implement in the future. ', '167.The deficits are mainly caused by the fact that the rise in government expenditure is outpacing the increase in government revenue, especially in terms of recurrent expenditure. Recurrent expenditure of the Government increased from about $150 billion in 1997-98 to about $470 billion in 2020-21, representing a more than three-fold increase. The significant rise in government expenditure in recent years is for enhancing services or investing for the future. However, as emphasised in my last Budget, government expenditure should enter a consolidation period, and the long-term financial commitments should also be commensurate with the increase in revenue.', ""168.As a number of measures announced in this year's Budget will have a bearing on the new financial year and the MRF, I would like to offer some explanations here."", '169.To optimise the use of fiscal reserves for seeking a better return to meet future needs, the Government set up the Future Fund in 2016 to make longer-term investments for a period of ten years. The investment return of the Fund forms an integral part of public financial resources, and has accumulated a return amounting to nearly $100 billion. While the Government has all along been disclosing the rate of return of the Future Fund, the investment return yet to be brought back has not been reflected under the cash-based government accounts. Starting from 2021-22, I will reflect the cumulative investment return of the Fund in the Operating Account on a progressive basis, with $25 billion brought back in the first year.', ""170.The 2021-22 Budget has also included $23 billion brought back from the Housing Reserve and the annual proceeds of about $35 billion from the expansion of the Government Green Bond Programme as mentioned earlier. The sums raised under the Government Green Bond Programme will provide funding for green projects under the Capital Works Reserve Fund but will not be used to finance operating expenditure, and hence will not undermine public finance discipline. The issuance of bonds cannot bolster our real financial strength as it ultimately requires the repayment of principal and interest. Nonetheless, the issuance of additional green bonds for financing eligible projects can definitely relieve the Government's fiscal pressure arising from the need to use existing resources to meet capital expenditure. This is a reasonable and appropriate approach in the light of the current low interest rate environment, and is also conducive to the development of Hong Kong's bond market. "", ""171.The above measures of bringing back the Future Fund's investment return and the Housing Reserve and issuing additional green bonds will ensure that our fiscal reserves can be maintained at a relatively robust level despite deficit budgets in the next few years. They would enhance confidence in Hong Kong's fiscal strength and is conducive to maintaining our financial stability. However, in the long run, the key to maintaining healthy public finances is to follow the principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenue and ensure that the growth of expenditure is commensurate with economic growth.

In 2021-22, the recurrent funding for these three policy areas amounts to $302.3 billion in total, accounting for 58 per cent of the Government's total estimated recurrent expenditure and representing an increase of 45 per cent over the provision of $208.2 billion in 2017-18."", '173.The Government will set an example by cutting expenditure so as to strengthen fiscal discipline.

The objective is to trim recurrent expenditure by one per cent in 2022-23. The estimated savings will be about $3.9 billion. While it seems not too difficult to achieve the one per cent cut in recurrent expenditure, there is limited room for curbing expenses related to personal emoluments which account for about 60 per cent of recurrent expenditure of government departments. We can only achieve the target mainly through savings from the remaining 40 per cent of recurrent expenditure, including major items such as general expenses and subventions.

The financial crisis triggered by the US sub-prime mortgage problem is the most severe for the world economy since the Great Depression in the 1930s.  This once-in-a-century financial turmoil has spread from the financial markets to the real economy, leading to a synchronised global recession.  Being a small open economy, Hong Kong will inevitably be hit by the turmoil and our economy will slide into recession.', "" 3.At times such as this, we need far-sightedness and courage.  We also need to be strategic in our thinking and have the ability in problem solving so as to arrest as best we can the knock-on effects of the financial crisis.  More importantly, we need to use our expertise to anticipate the development of the financial turmoil by taking countermeasures and making judgement in light of circumstances. We are responding with measures to ease the liquidity crunch in the financial system, relieve financing difficulties faced by enterprises, and bolster the community's confidence."", ' 4.I will be responsive to social problems arising from the economic downturn, including unemployment, reduced incomes, and the negative wealth effect of lower property and stock values.  I will provide a full, clear and honest account of our economic prospects.  Through clear appreciation of the troubles we face together, we will endure and overcome them together.', ' 5.To our citizens, having a job is of the utmost importance.  In a financial crisis, having a secure job is like an anchor that provides stability to a ship in rough seas.  The best way to preserve jobs is to improve our economy.  Therefore, while we need to create more employment opportunities in the near future, we should concentrate on promoting medium and long-term development, strengthen our economic foundations, bolster our existing strengths and tap new opportunities during this worldwide economic slump.  The financial turmoil has impacted on the life of many citizens.  Until the turmoil subsides, we need to help those with new or added burdens so that they can overcome the present difficulties.', ' 6.In preparing this Budget, I have been guided by three principles.  First, in response to the economic recession and rising unemployment, I have given priority to measures that are effective in creating jobs and supporting employment.  Second, I have sought measures that can increase the overall competitiveness of our economy and enhance the quality of life for our society.  Third, to foster a return to healthy growth in the economy, I have sought measures that promote a more sustainable economic development, tap new opportunities, and provide new economic drivers to benefit Hong Kong in the long run.7.In this Budget, I will explain the short, medium and long-term strategies to be adopted by the Government, adhering to the principles of prudent management of public finances and acting in the interest of our citizens:', 'In the short term, I will introduce more measures to strengthen the employment programme we have implemented since last September to counter the financial crisis;', '8.Troubled times have come, but I am confident that with tenacity and wisdom we can weather this financial storm and put Hong Kong back on course again as a vibrant city of opportunity.

I forecast a deficit of $9.8 billion in the Operating Account and a deficit of $30.1 billion in the Capital Financing Statement. This results in a deficit of $39.9 billion in the Consolidated Account, equivalent to 2.4 per cent of our GDP.  Fiscal reserves are estimated at $448.1 billion by end March 2010, equivalent to 18 months of government expenditure.', ' 129.For the medium term, I estimate that the annual average growth rate will be 3.5 per cent in real terms for the period 2010-13, while the inflation rate forecast will average two per cent.  I forecast a deficit in the Operating Account for the next three years, and followed by a return to surplus in our Operating Account in 2012-13, with a further increase in surplus in the subsequent year.', ""130.As regards capital revenue and spending, I will continue to invest heavily in infrastructure so as to counter the financial crisis, create employment and enhance the long-term competitiveness of Hong Kong.  With the major infrastructure projects entering their construction peaks and an expected decrease in land revenue, I forecast a capital financing deficit for some time in the future.  Our annual capital works expenditure will be at a very high level over the next few years, and may reach $50 billion.  This will pose challenges to the construction industry.  We will pay close attention to the construction industry's capacity to avoid bunching of projects causing tension in the supply of construction workers and cost fluctuations."", "" 131.In this time of economic turbulence, the preparation of this year's Budget has been a great challenge.  Following the principles of prudent financial management and keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues as stipulated in Article 107 of the Basic Law, I have prepared a Budget that is in the best interests of the public.  In light of the current economic environment and needs of the community, I hold to the view that expenditure for next year should be maintained at a high level despite a fall in revenue.  Although this will lead to a deficit in 2009-10, requiring us to draw on the fiscal reserves, I consider it appropriate.  The Government should show its commitments to the community during exceptional times.  In the medium term, with the recovery of the economy and our control of operating expenditure, I forecast that the consolidated deficit                   will gradually decline and we will largely achieve fiscal balance by 2013-14.  I estimate that the fiscal reserves will be about $390 billion by end March 2014, equivalent to 14 months of government expenditure."", '2009–10                      ($ billion)', '2010-11($ billion)', '2011-12($ billion)', '2012-13($ billion) ', '2013-14($ billion)', 'Operating revenue ', '234.2', '235.3', '253.7                       ', '273.5                       ', '290.0                       ', 'Operating expenditure ', '244.0                       ', '249.4                       ', '258.1                       ', '267.1                       ', '276.4                       ', 'Operating surplus/(deficit)', '(9.8)                       ', '(14.1)', '(4.4)                       ', '6.4', '13.6', 'Capital revenue', '27.5                       ', '44.3                       ', '52.1                       ', '53.7                       ', '56.3                       ', 'Capital spending (including payments from the Capital Investment Fund)                       ', '54.1                       ', '55.2', '69.6                       ', '68.9                       ', '71.2', 'Repayment of government bonds and notes', '3.5 ', '— ', '— ', '— ', '— ', 'Capital financing deficit ', '(30.1)                       ', '(10.9)                       ', '(17.5)                       ', '(15.2)                       ', '(14.9)                       ', 'Consolidated deficit', '(39.9)                       ', '(25.0)                       ', '(21.9)                       ', '(8.8)                       ', '(1.3)                       ', '- as a percentage of GDP', '2.4%', '1.5%                       ', '1.2%                       ', '0.5%                       ', '0.1%                       ', 'Fiscal reserves', '448.1                       ', '423.1                       ', '401.2                       ', '392.4                       ', '391.1                       ', '- as number of months of government expenditure                       ', '18                       ', '17                       ', '15                       ', '14                       ', '14                       ', '- as a percentage of GDP', '27.2%', '24.6%                       ', '22.3%                       ', '20.9%                       ', '19.9%                       ', 'Public expenditure ', '319.4                       ', '326.8                       ', '350.0                       ', '358.7                       ', '370.9                       ', '- as a percentage of GDP', '19.4%                       ', '19.0%                       ', '19.5%                       ', '19.1%                       ', '18.9%                       ', ' | ']"
574,2009,Concluding Remarks,"['Concluding Remarks', '132.Mr President, since reunification, we have gone through a number of economic crises, such as the Asian financial turmoil in 1997 and 1998, and the major downturn triggered by the SARS outbreak in 2003.  Some people inevitably feel worried and upset when facing difficulties.  However, timely and effective policies, coupled with the collective wisdom and efforts of Hong Kong people, allowed us to overcome these challenges and scale new heights each time.', ' 133.In my last Budget, I said that ""Ready to Face, Dare to Hope"" best described the conviction of Hong Kong people.  Hong Kong people are ready to face the realities and challenges of today, and dare to hope for our future.  By working hard, we will reap the rewards of our efforts and eventually overcome difficulties.  It is this belief that gives us the courage to stand up to challenges and, because of this confidence, we can boldly embrace tomorrow.', ' 134.The current financial turmoil is severe and unsettling, and is wreaking terrible damage.  Some people feel uncertain about the future; some are anxious about their investment loss; and some are worried about their jobs.  I feel their anxiety, and share their concerns.  As before, we will face these challenges together.  We will do our best to keep abreast of this evolving crisis, and introduce effective measures to lessen its impact.', "" 135.We must dare to face this financial turmoil and must believe we can overcome it.  The people of Hong Kong have weathered tough times before and will weather them again.  During the SARS outbreak, our healthcare workers showed dedication and displayed commendable professionalism.  In hazardous firefighting operations, our firefighters carry out their mission with the spirit of self-sacrifice.  This is what we all know as the 'Hong Kong Spirit' and this is what gives me confidence to say that Hong Kong will overcome this current crisis."", ' 136.In this Budget, we have announced initiatives that will create about 62000 jobs and internship opportunities.  We will invest heavily to foster a caring society.  We will introduce measures to sustain economic development and maintain our economic vibrancy. ', ' 137.The current financial turmoil is undoubtedly a severe test that poses challenges to individuals, families, enterprises, societies and governments.  At this crucial moment, it is with no small amount of trepidation that I, as Financial Secretary, am serving the citizens and braving the storm with you under the weight of a challenging mission.  In meeting the challenges ahead, we should also realise that the Government cannot solve all problems.  Jobs created by the Government are no substitute for jobs created in the private sector.  Effective help for the disadvantaged also requires community support and involvement.  Economic development requires us all to go beyond our current strengths and advantages to create new economic drivers.  All of this requires us to play our part.  With confidence in ourselves and in our abilities, we can create the future that we want. We can rebuild wealth and competitiveness, and we can realise our goal of building a caring community.', ' 138.A German theologian said, ""The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world that it leaves to its children"".  I hope that our children will inherit a society that upholds our conviction in meeting future challenges while daring to hope for a better tomorrow.', ' | ']"
575,2015,[Introduction],"['Mr President,', ' I move that the Appropriation Bill 2015 be read a second time.', '2.Today is the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, our common birthday in the Chinese tradition. May I wish you, Mr President, Members and fellow citizens good health and happiness in the Year of the Ram.', '3.2014 was an extraordinary year for all of us. Momentous events, local and global, changed the lives of many and transformed our city. Events are still unfolding, and will require our close scrutiny. But, one thing is for sure – a totally different environment has emerged which presents new challenges ahead.', '4.Since the start of 2015, the international political arena and global financial markets have provided plenty of breaking news. The launch of quantitative easing by Europe and Japan has increased global liquidity. On top of heightened geopolitical tensions in a number of regions, terrorism has added further uncertainty and once again rattled the nerves of the international community. Locally, with constitutional reform entering the next stage, we anticipate that disputes, both inside and outside the Council, will become even more vehement this year.', '5.The long drawn out unlawful occupy movement disrupted different facets of the city to varying degrees. The serious divisions in society that emerged during the 79 days has not only affected the image of Hong Kong, but also aroused concern about much more radical social conflict which in turn will make it harder to mend conflicted relationships among people.', '6.Without doubt, the social issues revealed during the incident did not come about, nor can they be resolved, overnight. We should seek to narrow our differences and pursue consensus with patience and pragmatism. Prolonged bickering will only bog down our development.', '7.I am glad to see that most people do care dearly for our home, Hong Kong. People do cherish our fine tradition of the rule of law, and do not want to see our well-developed systems eroded. Diversity, openness, peace and freedom are not only our core values, but also the foundations of our success, and the most reliable co-ordinates of our development path. If we can firmly grasp these fundamentals, we shall be more confident charting our way forward.', ""8.This year's Budget will complement the initiatives announced in the Policy Address and address the constraints on land and manpower through the effective use of resources. We seek to reinforce the foundation for long-term economic development. In addition to capitalising on our strengths, I shall explore new ideas and strive for diversity to help members of the community realise their aspirations. In particular, I shall make the best use of resources generated by the community's efforts, and continue to care for the disadvantaged and promote sustainable development, so that people from different sectors as well as our next generations can share the benefits of economic growth.""]"
576,2015,[Economic Performance in 2014],"[""9.Global economic performance was less than spectacular in 2014. Despite the steady performance of the Mainland's economy and signs of recovery in the US, our trade performance was beset by Eurozone's weakening economy and Japan's relapse into recession. Merchandise exports grew by one per cent and service exports by 0.5 per cent in real terms. As a result, our economy grew by only 2.3 per cent last year, the third consecutive year with a growth rate lower than the annual average of 3.9 per cent over the past decade."", '10.The unemployment rate averaged at a low level of 3.2 per cent for the year as a whole, sustaining a state of full employment. Private consumption expenditure maintained moderate growth, but investment expenditure was soft and sentiment turned cautious.', ""11.Inflation continued to ease. Overall rentals rose, but the rises were generally modest. With steady increases in labour costs and mild imported inflation, the headline inflation rate for 2014 was 4.4 per cent. Netting out the effects of Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate was 3.5 per cent, lower than the four per cent in 2013."", ""12.Prolonged political bickering is detrimental to public administration and the international image of Hong Kong as a stable, law-abiding and efficient city. It may even dampen investors' confidence in Hong Kong. Such self-inflicted harm does not serve the city well. The occupy movement affected tourism, hotel, catering, retail and transport industries, etc. to varying degrees. To offset the impact on economic confidence, I shall implement an array of support measures targeting affected industries and launch a new round of efforts to promote Hong Kong.""]"
577,2015,[Targeted Support    Measures],"['13.I shall launch the following short-term measures to support the affected sectors –', '(a)waive the licence fees for 1800 travel agents for six months;', '(b)waive the licence fees for 2000 hotels and guesthouses for six months;', '(c)waive the licence fees for restaurants and hawkers and fees for restricted food permits for six months, benefiting 26000 restaurants and operators in total; and', '(d)waive the fees for vehicle examination once for the renewal of vehicle licences of taxis, light buses, franchised and non-franchised buses, goods vehicles, trailers and special purpose vehicles within a year.']"
578,2015,[Rebuilding    Confidence],"[""14.More importantly, we need to rebuild international investors' and tourists' confidence in Hong Kong and uplift our international image. Starting from January, the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) has launched a new round of publicity in Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia and major Mainland cities."", ""15.I shall allocate an additional $80 million for HKTB to step up its promotion efforts in the coming year. These activities will include running overseas promotions, organising shopping festivals and offering merchandise concessions and electronic discount coupons in collaboration with the retail industry, and arranging large-scale familiarisation tours to Hong Kong for overseas trade missions. HKTB will expand the scale of overseas promotion fairs this year and waive local traders' participation fees."", '16.I shall also allocate an additional $26 million to the Information Services Department for inviting overseas media organisations and opinion leaders from around the world to visit Hong Kong, arranging for more overseas visits, and launching another round of publicity campaign for Brand Hong Kong. The Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), Hong Kong Trade Development Council and Hong Kong representation overseas, and in the Mainland and Taiwan will also organise promotional activities.', ""17.This series of support measures and promotion efforts, costing $290 million, will render the affected sectors some tangible assistance, help rebuild confidence in Hong Kong, and enhance the city's image.""]"
579,2015,[Economic Outlook for 2015],"['18.The year 2015 will be a challenging year. Amid improvement in the US economy, the US Federal Reserve Board is preparing to raise interest rates, running counter to the further easing measures pursued by the central banks of Europe and Japan. The stance of the new Greek government has added uncertainties to the market.', '19.The drop in international oil prices is beneficial to Hong Kong and other net energy importers. Excessive oil price volatility, however, will pose a real threat to the global economy and financial markets.', '20.The interaction of these factors will further complicate the external environment: (a) the US inflation outlook will be affected, making it more difficult to forecast the pace of interest rate rise; (b) rising deflation risks in Europe and Japan will add headwinds to the economic recovery; and (c) some oil exporting countries face huge pressures on finance and exchange rates due to geopolitical tensions and dropping oil prices. All these macroeconomic factors will upset the stability of global financial markets.', ""21.Emerging Asian markets are showing a better performance in general. The Mainland's economic growth is relatively stable but faces downward pressure this year. The global economy as a whole is likely to stay on a slow-growing path in the post-financial tsunami period. This, amid a stronger US dollar, will continue to put a drag on Hong Kong's trade performance."", '22.Domestically, local consumption and investment sentiment will be dampened by the increased uncertainties over the US interest rate hike and weaker spending power of inbound visitors. In the face of internal and external challenges, I forecast Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at one to three per cent in 2015.', '23.The labour market will hold largely stable. But if the domestic sector continues to be trapped in a slow-growing path, the pace of job creation by enterprises will be affected.', '24.As regards inflation, with the softening of global commodity prices in the past year, imported inflation will remain mild. Retail sales have weakened recently, and rental pressure is less than that in previous years. I forecast that the headline inflation rate for 2015 as a whole will be 3.5 per cent with an underlying inflation rate at three per cent.']"
580,2015,[Support for Small and Medium Enterprises],"[""25.Our external trade performance will be affected by a host of uncertainties this year. It can hardly drive our economic growth. As such, we shall need to rely on domestic demand for maintaining economic vibrancy and preserving employment. There are 320 000 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Hong Kong, accounting for 98 per cent of the total local enterprises and employing 50 per cent of the private sector workforce. This underscores SMEs' role as the mainstay of our economy. To support SMEs, I shall –"", '(a)extend the application period for the special concessionary measures under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme to 29February2016;', '(b)inject $1.5billion into the SME Export Marketing and Development Funds;', '(c)increase the maximum amount of funding support for each project under the SME Development Fund from $2million to $5million; and', '(d)expand the scope of the SME Export Marketing Fund.']"
581,2015,[Relief Measures],"[""26.I am aware that many of our citizens are expecting relief measures from Government to allay their burdens. In view of the challenging international macroeconomic environment, the unstable economic factors, the need to boost the local economy in the short term, and Government's relatively sound fiscal position in the short to medium term, I shall increase public expenditure in a prudent manner according to the principle of committing resources as and when justified and needed, and introduce the following one-off relief measures –"", '27.I have to point out that recurrent measures and one-off measures serve different objectives and purposes. The former addresses recurrent needs of the community, while the latter serves counter-cyclical objectives to provide cushioning effects for the economy and alleviate imminent economic hardships. They are not interchangeable.', '28.I raised the child allowances for three consecutive years from 2011-12 to 2013-14. Many parents want Government to provide more specific tax exemptions to ease their burden in taking care of their children. I understand the problems they are facing, but we need also to avoid complicating the tax regime. I shall increase the basic and additional child allowances from $70,000 to $100,000 from 2015-16 onwards. This will reduce government revenue by $2 billion each year.', '29.Amounting to $34 billion, the six relief measures above should help alleviate the financial burden on the public, stimulate consumption, stabilise the economy and preserve employment. Together with other measures in the Budget, they will have a fiscal stimulus effect of boosting GDP by one percentage point.', '(a)reduce salaries tax and tax under personal assessment for 2014-15 by 75percent, subject to a ceiling of $20,000. The reduction will be reflected in the final tax payable for 2014-15. This proposal will benefit 1.82million taxpayers in the territory and reduce government revenue by $15.8billion;', '(b)reduce profits tax for 2014-15 by 75percent, subject to a ceiling of $20,000. The reduction will be reflected in the final tax payable for 2014-15. This proposal will benefit 130000 taxpayers in the territory and reduce government revenue by $1.9billion;', '(c)waive rates for the first two quarters of 2015-16, subject to a ceiling of $2,500per quarter for each rateable property. It will benefit 3.15million properties and reduce government revenue by $7.7billion;', '(d)provide an extra allowance to Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) recipients, equal to two months of the standard rate CSSA payments, and an extra allowance to the recipients of Old Age Allowance, Old Age Living Allowance and Disability Allowance, equal to two months of the respective allowances. This will involve an additional expenditure of $5.5billion; and', ""(e)pay one month's rent for lower income tenants living in the rental units of the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS). Involving an expenditure of $1.1billion, this measure will not apply to tenants who are required to pay additional rent to HKHA and non-elderly tenants of the HKHS GroupB estates.""]"
582,2015,[Developing Our Economy],"[""30.My key mission as Financial Secretary is to maintain a favourable business environment, promote sustainable economic development, and make available diverse and quality jobs to enable citizens to lead better and more fulfilling lives. I must also ensure that Government has adequate resources to enhance social services and improve people's livelihood."", '31.Technologies have brought economic globalisation into a new phase. Competition between economies has never been so fierce as potential customers became more accessible to enterprises all over the world. Only the fittest will survive, a reality that local enterprises have to face.', ""32.This new norm enables enterprises to adopt modern modes of production led by global supply chains and choose the most competitive partners from around the world. With Hong Kong's established position as an international financial, trading and logistics hub, our commercial sector is accustomed to utilising supply chain management. This gives them the opportunity to benefit from the ample room for development brought about by the close connections between regions."", '33.In the face of such challenges and opportunities, we should seek to lay a solid foundation for long-term development in a pragmatic manner, and enhance our overall strengths step by step through adding value to traditional industries and developing diversified new industries.', '34.Manpower mismatch is becoming more and more evident in Hong Kong in recent years. This, coupled with the imminent challenge of an ageing population, has directly hindered the sustainable economic development of our city. We must strive to overcome the constraints on our development potential and rise to the challenges together. Otherwise, our next generations will have to bear the price of our short-sightedness.']"
583,2015,[Diversified Development],"['35.Hong Kong has long been a cradle for entrepreneurs. The city is renowned for its favourable business environment, with a fair and transparent market system, a liberal and open investment climate, and a simple and low tax regime. Legends of rags to riches live on for generations. Many entrepreneurs started their business without much experience, technology or capital. But their flexibility and market acumen have opened up new opportunities in different trades and markets.', '36.Social enterprises are gaining recognition in Hong Kong. With business models that balance economic and other social values, they mark the maturing of our society. Research showed that each dollar of public funding contributed four to seven dollars of workfare to those disadvantaged employees, reflecting the significant benefits brought about by social enterprises.', ""37.Diversified and dynamic, Hong Kong boasts a melting pot of cultures with a blooming talent pool in the cultural and creative sectors. I shall take the fashion industry, the film industry and the arts and culture sector as examples to unveil Government's initiatives in promoting these industries.""]"
584,2015,[Start-ups],"['38.A new wave of entrepreneurship, in the form of start-ups, is emerging around the world. Many start-ups boldly apply new technologies, information technology in particular, disrupting the traditional mode of operation. They translate state-of-the-art technologies into competitive products and services that change consumption patterns and open up new markets.', '39.Last few years saw a notable burgeoning of start-ups in Hong Kong. They managed to build up a wider clientele base by conducting in-depth market studies, over and above their clearly-defined positioning and inspiring marketing strategies. I have seen an enterprise developing wireless chargers for electronic devices, and another designing a mobile application for pre-ordering coffee.', '40.Hong Kong is among the most advanced information and communication technology hubs in the world. Our well-established business support services and sound system to protect intellectual property (IP) rights provide favourable conditions for the growth of start-ups. Many public and private organisations offer support, including provision of co-working space, incubation programmes, business advisory services, and assistance in building partner networks. The number of such organisations has increased by tenfold over the past three years, and they include world-renowned organisations such as Nest and Accenture.', '41.InvestHK launched a large promotion campaign known as ""StartmeupHK"" two years ago to promote our advantages as a leading global hub for start-ups. The campaign has attracted innovative start-ups with potential to our city, and brought Hong Kong-based enterprises to the attention of many international angel and venture capital investors.', '42.We have witnessed a growing interest amongst investors in Hong Kong start-ups. International IT giants such as Microsoft have set up offices here to look for new businesses that are worth investing in. Start-ups nurtured by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC) and the Cyberport have also attracted hundreds of millions of dollars of investment.', '43.Financing needs increase as start-ups grow. To further encourage financing of new enterprises, HKSTPC will earmark $50 million to set up a corporate venture fund for co-investment, on a matching basis with private funds, in start-ups which are located in the Science Park or have participated in its incubation programmes. I shall also ask the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (HKMC) to expand and enhance the Microfinance Scheme.', '44.In addition, the proposed injection of $5 billion to the Innovation and Technology Fund will help strengthen support for relevant enterprises.', '45.We strive to provide start-ups with enhanced hardware and software support. HKSTPC will extend the Leading Enterprises Acceleration Programme to help more companies with potential to consolidate their businesses, raise capital and improve corporate management.', '46.From this year onwards, free online government information will be released in digital formats to encourage development of more applications by start-ups. Many start-ups have developed a wide range of mobile applications by exploiting such public sector information, including information on real-time traffic and weather conditions.', '47.Financial technologies are also an investment target of many venture capitalists or crowd funding efforts. Financial technologies that help facilitate functions such as payment, clearing and settlement systems, big data analytics, cloud computing, information and risk management and network security can enhance operational efficiency and help open new modes of development for the financial sector. Being an international financial centre with years of experience in technology, Hong Kong is an ideal place for developing financial technologies. I have asked the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury to set up a steering group to study how to develop Hong Kong into a financial technology hub together with industries, research and development institutions as well as regulatory authorities.', '48.I hope to improve the ecosystem for local start-ups and technological enterprises to tie in with the general direction of moving our economy up the value chain and enabling local industries to diversify.']"
585,2015,[Social Enterprises],"['49.With the relentless and concerted efforts of Government and various sectors over the years, local social enterprises have attained solid growth. Their scope of services and target clients have become more diversified, earning wider recognition from the community. Apart from creating job opportunities, social enterprises also engage people from different sectors to serve the community. For instance, there are social enterprises renting domestic units to single-parent families with imminent housing need as co-tenants at below-market rates, offering barrier-free taxi services to wheelchair users, and operating restaurants to create jobs for women living in the same district.', '50.Since the launch of the Enhancing Self-Reliance Through District Partnership Programme (ESR Programme) in 2006, the Home Affairs Department has so far allocated a total of $180 million for the establishment of 161 social enterprises, which created 2 600 job opportunities. Eighty per cent of these social enterprises have become self-sustaining after the funding period.', '51.I shall earmark $150 million to roll out a new phase of the ESR Programme from 2016-17 to 2019-20, under which enhancement measures will be implemented to benefit more types of social enterprises and encourage greater participation of the commercial sector in the development of social enterprises.']"

The initiatives feature ""five links"" in the arenas of policy, facilities, trade, capital and culture.', '63.Many countries along the ""One Belt One Road"" have great development potential. To strengthen trade ties with these markets, Hong Kong should expand co-operation, organise exchange visits, gain a deeper understanding of these countries, as well as pursue negotiations on Free Trade Agreements, Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements and Comprehensive Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements. Trade facilitation and investment promotion to secure business opportunities in various aspects should also be developed.', '64.Hong Kong can work with Mainland provinces and municipalities to stage roadshows in these countries to facilitate trade and investment flows for regional economic integration.

It is imperative for us to take forward the development of a three-runway system (3RS) in order to meet our long-term air traffic demand, and to maintain our status as an international and regional aviation centre in the face of fierce competition from other airports in the region. Having gone through the environmental impact assessment process, the Airport Authority (AA) has submitted its recommendations on the planning of the 3RS to Government.', '72.I envisage that the construction works for the 3RS could commence in 2016 for commissioning in 2023.

The Employees Retraining Board will also focus on providing training for older persons, among other target groups, and help them re-join the job market.', '137.I shall earmark $220 million to extend for two years the Integrated Employment Assistance Programme for Self-reliance, which encourages employable able-bodied CSSA recipients to secure employment and achieve self-reliance.', '138.The Labour Department will also continue to employ, on a trial basis, ethnic minority trainees under the Youth Employment and Training Programme as employment services ambassadors to provide employment services to other ethnic minority job seekers.', '139.I encourage employers to introduce more flexible working arrangements. I hope they would allow employees to work from home, or offer part-time and job sharing alternatives, to enable more people with family commitments to join the workforce.']"
610,2015,[Healthcare],"[""140.With ageing population, Government will continue to increase resources on healthcare. In 2015-16, Government's recurrent allocation to the Hospital Authority (HA) will be $49 billion, up by nearly 50 per cent over five years ago."", ""141.To cater for the long-term demand for healthcare services, we shall carry out a number of hospital projects. Projects already under construction or planning include the development of an acute general hospital in the Kai Tak Development Area (Phase 1), Tin Shui Wai Hospital and Hong Kong Children's Hospital; the redevelopment of Kwong Wah Hospital and Queen Mary Hospital; and the expansion of United Christian Hospital. A total of 2 800 additional beds will be provided. The works expenditure is estimated at $81 billion."", '142.In the 2008-09 Budget, I earmarked $50 billion to support healthcare reform. I shall, in light of public views, inject funds into the high risk pool under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, and provide tax concession for subscribers to regulated insurance products. To alleviate pressure on the public healthcare system due to manpower shortages and surge in demand, I shall set up a fund for HA to make use of investment returns for public-private partnership initiatives. One of these is to extend in phases the General Out-patient Clinic Public-Private Partnership Programme to all 18 districts. I shall also offer loans to non-profit-making organisations for private hospital development to address the acute shortage of private hospital beds. The remaining sum will be reserved for general use, including provision of support for public hospital projects.']"
611,2015,[Retirement Protection],"['143.Government has, since the 1960s, been studying different forms of retirement protection, on which there have been wide discussions and diverse views in the community. The Commission on Poverty will consult the public again on retirement protection in the latter half of this year.', '144.The sustainability of retirement protection must be a prime concern. ""Pay-as-you-go"" retirement protection means that the contributions from today\'s employees and employers are used to pay the pensions of retirees of the previous generation. In other words, funding for retirement protection for people in this generation is to be borne by the next generation.', '145.Overseas experiences suggest that, as population ages, the proportion of dependants to the working population increases, retirement protection on a ""pay-as-you-go"" basis eventually becomes unsustainable. There would either be less protection for the dependent population or heavier burden on the working population. We should consider carefully the consequences of this scenario when we discuss retirement protection.', ""146.Irrespective of the community's choice for the way forward on this issue, the community's consensus is to provide better retirement protection for the elderly in need. I shall set aside $50 billion for this purpose.""]"
612,2015,[Public Finances],"['147.In its report released last year, the Working Group on Long-Term Fiscal Planning pointed out that with an ageing population and slowing economic growth, government expenditure would keep growing at a faster pace than that of revenue and the economy. If this trend persists, structural deficits will surface within ten years. While Hong Kong would still experience budget surpluses in the coming few years, we need to take early and positive actions to contain expenditure, preserve the revenue base and save up in a timely manner to avoid the appearance of structural deficits.']"
613,2015,[Containing Expenditure],"['148.In light of the Working Group\'s recommendations, I asked all policy bureaux in the middle of last year to achieve more efficient use of resources through re-engineering and re-prioritising. I have also launched the ""0‑1‑1"" envelope savings programme to reduce operating expenditure by a total of two per cent over the next three financial years. Resources saved will be re-allocated for new services.']"
614,2015,[Preserving Revenue Base],"['149.Hong Kong maintains a simple and low tax regime with a narrow tax base. Among the working population, only 40 per cent pays salaries tax, and 60 per cent of the revenue comes from the top five per cent of the payers of salaries tax. As for profits tax, only ten per cent of the registered corporations pay the tax, and over 80 per cent of the revenue comes from the top five per cent of payers of profits tax. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for Government to stabilise and broaden the revenue base.', '150.Two years ago, I asked government departments to comprehensively review over a thousand fees and charges in accordance with the ""cost-recovery"" and ""user pays"" principles. The review is supported by LegCo and our efforts have begun to bear fruits. We shall next review livelihood-related fees and charges.', '151.Government launched an extensive consultation on the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax in 2006. The community then did not support the new tax. We may explore again the feasibility of broadening the tax base in due course with the aim of stabilising government revenue and creating room for direct tax concessions.']"
615,2015,[Saving up in a Timely Manner],"['152.In late 2014, the Working Group suggested establishing a Future Fund, comprising an endowment of $220 billion from the Land Fund, which is part of the fiscal reserves, and a proportion of future budget surpluses. The Future Fund will serve as long-term savings and be placed in long-term investments for higher returns.', '153.I agree to establish a Future Fund. I have requested the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury to work with the Chief Executive of HKMA to hammer out specific management and investment mechanisms. The savings scheme is expected to be in place within this year.', ""154.The Working Group also offered recommendations on how Government's assets could be better managed. We shall follow up on their recommendations. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the experts and academics on the Working Group for their contributions over the past two years.""]"
616,2015,[Revised Estimates for 2014-15],"['155.I forecast that the revised estimate for government revenue for 2014-15 will be $470.7 billion, 9.4 per cent or $40.6 billion higher than the original estimate. It reflects mainly the changes in the following revenue items and the arrangement for the Housing Reserve –', '156.As for government expenditure, I forecast a revised estimate of $397.2 billion, 3.4 per cent or $14 billion lower than the original estimate.', '157.For 2014-15, I forecast a surplus of $63.8 billion, and by 31 March 2015, fiscal reserves are expected to reach $819.5 billion.', '(a)stamp duty revenue is $29.7billion higher than the original estimate, representing an increase of over 60percent. Of this revenue, over 75percent comes from ""double stamp duty"" which was not budgeted;', '(b)revenue from profits tax is $18.5billion or 15.8percent higher than originally estimated. It is affected mainly by corporate earnings which are far more volatile than macroeconomic growth, rendering it difficult for us to make an accurate estimate; and', '(c)revenues from salaries tax and land premium are $5.1billion and $3.2billion higher than their respective original estimates.']"
617,2015,[Estimates for 2015-16],"[""158.Operating expenditure for 2015-16 is estimated to be $354.3 billion, representing an increase of 11.5 per cent or $36.6 billion over the revised estimate for 2014-15. Recurrent expenditure accounts for $324.6 billion, or over 90 per cent of the 2015-16 operating expenditure, which is an increase of $18.3 billion or six per cent over the revised estimate for 2014-15. In the past ten years, recurrent expenditure has been increasing with a cumulative growth of 73.4 per cent over 2005-06. This demonstrates Government's continued commitment towards improving people's livelihood."", '159.Of the recurrent expenditure for the next financial year, almost 60 per cent will be deployed for education, health and social welfare, the three major livelihood-related policy areas. Recurrent expenditure on education, the largest spending area of Government, will be $71.4 billion, or 22 per cent of recurrent expenditure. New initiatives to be introduced from the 2015/16 academic year include progressively increasing the intake of senior-year undergraduate places in University Grants Committee-funded institutions from 4 000 to 5 000 per annum in the 2018/19 academic year, costing $475 million a year; and increasing the ratio of graduate teacher posts in public sector primary schools in phases, costing $328 million a year. Further to the increase in voucher value of the Pre-primary Education Voucher Scheme by $2,500 in the 2014/15 school year, the voucher value will again be adjusted upward by $2,500 in the 2015/16 school year; and the fee remission ceiling of the Kindergarten and Child Care Centre Fee Remission Scheme will also be raised in these two school years. These will involve additional expenditure of $840 million in the two school years.', ""160.Recurrent expenditure on medical and health services will be $54.5 billion, accounting for 16.8 per cent of recurrent expenditure. We shall continue to enhance our public healthcare services. Measures include providing 250 additional hospital beds, expanding the capacity of specialist out-patient clinics and general out-patient clinics, strengthening geriatric rehabilitation and outreach services, and increasing operating theatre sessions. More drugs with proven efficacy will be incorporated into the Hospital Authority Drug Formulary. These include the expansion of clinical application of special drug for treating multiple sclerosis, as well as new drugs for treating cancer, chronic hepatitis C and Crohn's disease. A total of 4 000 patients will benefit each year."", ""161.Recurrent expenditure on welfare will reach $59.7 billion, accounting for 18.4 per cent of recurrent expenditure. Ever since it was launched three years ago, the Public Transport Fare Concession Scheme for the Elderly and Eligible Persons with Disabilities has gradually been extended to cover MTR, franchised buses and ferries to benefit more people. From late March 2015, the scheme will be extended to cover green minibuses by phases. The recurrent expenditure of the scheme has increased by threefold to $900 million in three years' time. In addition, I shall increase the annual recurrent expenditure by $71 million to provide additional places for day care and residential care for the elderly, and improve relevant services. Government will also strengthen various support services for persons with disabilities and ex-mentally ill persons, including residential care services and community support services, which will involve an additional annual expenditure of $160 million."", '162.I forecast that capital expenditure for 2015-16 will be $86.5 billion, including $70 billion on capital works. We have launched various capital works in recent years for developing transport infrastructure, increasing land supply, as well as medical, educational and leisure facilities, etc. They are of paramount importance in furthering socio-economic development and enhancing quality of life.', '163.With a number of projects entering their construction peaks, capital works expenditure is expected to maintain at relatively high levels in the next few years. We are, however, concerned about the sluggish progress of deliberation in LegCo since the last session. This has resulted in the mounting of backlog of funding proposals.', '164.Total government expenditure is estimated to reach $440.8 billion in the next financial year, 11 per cent more than that of last year. Public expenditure will be equivalent to 20.4 per cent of GDP.', '165.The civil service establishment is expected to expand by 2 540 posts to 176 448 in 2015-16, representing a year-on-year increase of 1.5 per cent, similar to that of 2014-15. This has to do with manpower increase in government departments for implementing new policies and improving existing services.', '166.Total government revenue for 2015-16 is estimated to be $477.6 billion, of which earnings and profits tax is estimated at $194.6 billion. Land revenue is estimated to be $70 billion.', '167.Taking all these into account, I forecast a surplus of $36.8 billion in the Consolidated Account in the coming year. Fiscal reserves are estimated to be $856.3 billion by the end of March 2016, representing 36.8 per cent of GDP and equivalent to 23 months of government expenditure.']"
618,2015,[Medium Range Forecast],"[""168.Since the global financial crisis in 2008, the annual growth rate of Hong Kong's economy averaged 2.6 per cent in real terms, lower than our average trend growth rate of 3.8 per cent in the decade before the crisis."", '169.For the medium term, the average annual growth rate is forecast to be 3.5 per cent in real terms from 2016 to 2019, and the underlying inflation rate will average three per cent.', '170.I forecast an annual surplus in the Operating Account and an annual deficit in the Capital Account in the four years from 2016‑17. But a surplus is expected in the Consolidated Account in all years.', '171.Fiscal reserves are estimated at $948.8 billion by end-March 2020, representing 33.6 per cent of GDP and equivalent to 22 months of government expenditure.', '172.The medium range forecast is broadly in line with the trend projections of the Working Group. The ageing population will inevitably put mounting pressure on government expenditure and a shrinking workforce will slow down economic growth. We must remain vigilant, and take timely and resolute multi-pronged measures to avert the structural deficit problem.']"

Our economy recovered                        throughout 2004, moving out of the doldrums that had                        beset us since the Asian financial crisis.                        Last year, it grew by 8.1 percent, the                        highest rate in four years and well above the average                        annual growth rate of 4.8 percent over the past 20                        years. This                        suggests that our economy is back on an upward track                        following the adjustments over the past few years.', '5. Our external trade in 2004                        remained buoyant: total exports of goods and offshore                        trade both surged by 15 percent.                        The number of visitor arrivals for the year                        reached an all-time high of 21.81 million.                        Private consumption increased significantly, by                        6.7 percent. Likewise,                        investment in industrial machinery, after falling for                        several years, resumed positive growth, with an overall                        increase of 20 per cent for the year, the highest since                        2000. Property                        values rebounded, and the number of homeowners with                        negative equity fell drastically from about 106                        000 in                        the middle of 2003 to around 19000 at the end of                        2004. The                        number of bankruptcy petitions also decreased from more                        than 22                        000 in                        2003 to about 12                        000 in                        2004, and was the lowest in four years.', '6.

622,2005,2004-05 Outturn,"['8. As our economy put in a                        strong performance last year, revenue from various                        sources was higher than expected.', '9.                        For the                        Consolidated Account, I estimate that a surplus of $12                        billion will be achieved in 2004?5, equivalent to 0.9                        per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).                        This is the first time since 1999?000 that the                        Consolidated Account has recorded a surplus, and is                        mainly due to lower-than-expected expenditure and                        higher-than-expected revenue this year, capital revenue                        in particular. For                        example, land premiums amount to $31.3 billion, more                        than two and a half times the original estimate.                        Operating revenues such as salaries tax, profits                        tax and stamp duty are also higher than expected, with                        increases in these items ranging from 9 to 40 percent.', '10.                        I must, however, stress                        that the main reason for the surplus is that revenue                        from land premiums is far greater than expected.                        As such revenue is volatile and is affected by a                        number of factors, we cannot rely too heavily on it to                        fund operating expenditure.                        Moreover, the sums raised by issuing bonds in                        2004?5 will have to be repaid.                        Discounting the proceeds from bond issuances, the                        Consolidated Account will still record a deficit of$13.4 billion.', '11.                        As far as the Operating                        Account is concerned, I am pleased to announce that                        operating expenditure for 2004?5 will be lower than                        that for 2003?4.                        Barring two special accounting arrangements with                        the former municipal councils, this is the first time in                        over 50 years that operating expenditure has fallen.', '12.                        This demonstrates that the                        various control measures taken by the Government are                        gradually producing results. These                        include reduction in the civil service establishment,                        adjustments to civil service pay, reprioritisation of                        service provision, structural reorganisation and                        streamlining of procedures.                        I am grateful for the joint efforts of Directors                        of Bureaux and my colleagues in the civil service.                        This also shows that our civil service has the                        flexibility to try new approaches and has striven to                        reduce operating expenditure while maintaining a quality                        service. The                        operating deficit for 2004?5 is forecast to be $14.1billion, much                        lower than the $46.6 billion originally estimated.', ""13.

I know that members of the public are unhappy                        about this. Last                        year, I pledged that the Government would first cut down                        on spending in order to demonstrate our readiness for                        action. One                        year later, we have succeeded in checking the trend of                        our operating expenditure, which had been on the rise                        for over 50 years.

The                         development of the Mainland has also emerged as a strong                         competitive force for                          Hong Kong                         , threatening even some of our industries which had long                         had an edge over our competitors, such as logistics.                        Furthermore, increasing globalisation has a                         continuous impact on our strengths.                        There are also potential problems in the local                         economy. For                         example, unemployment in certain industries remains                         high, our economy is undergoing adjustment and the                         problem of the structural deficit has yet to be                         resolved. On                         the other hand, as our economy continues to improve, we                         must assiduously monitor inflation and property price                         movement, so as to avoid a major increase in business                         costs."", ""15.

The Economic and Employment Council established                        last year has identified the construction and retail                        industries, which have a significant influence on our                        economy and the job market, for regulatory review.                        The review aims to facilitate businesses by                        breaking down barriers and streamlining procedures.                        The Council is particularly concerned that many                        types of licences are required for a commercial                        undertaking and involve lengthy procedures.                        One of the main objectives of the review is                        therefore to look into the feasibility of issuing                        composite licences and, where practicable, introducing                        third-party certification or self-certification.                        This would expedite the licensing process and                        enable the departments concerned to redeploy resources                        and step up enforcement action, thereby reducing                        irregularities. We                        expect the Council to complete the review and put                        forward specific proposals by the end of this year.', '19.

Under both phases of CEPA, a total of 1108                        products have been granted tariff-free treatment.

Under                        Phase II, the liberalisation of trade in services has                        been extended to 26 sectors.

We are also working in collaboration with leaders                        of the relevant Mainland provinces and regions to                        promote Guangdong/Hong Kong co-operation and Pan-PRD                        co-operation under the ?+                        2?/st1:chmetcnv>                        , in order to enhance our regional economic hinterland                        and efficiency.

627,2005,Enchancing our Position as International Financial Centre,"[""26. Hong Kong's development as an                        international financial centre during the past year was                        most encouraging. Hong                        Kong ranked first in Asia and third in the world last                        year in terms of capital raised, with total Initial                        Public Offering (IPO) and post-IPO equity funds reaching                        some $265 billion, out-performing the                         London                        and Tokyo Stock Exchanges.                        Market capitalisation also hit a new high of                        about $6,650 billion, nearly 50 percent above the                        pre-reunification level.                        In                         Hong Kong                        , Mainland enterprises have raised over $900 billion                        since the introduction of H-shares in 1993.                        As at the end of last year, a total of 304                        Mainland enterprises had listed here, 22 per cent more                        than in 2003 and representing over a quarter of the                        total number of listed companies in Hong Kong.                        These enterprises accounted for about 30percent                        of our total stock market capitalisation.                        Trading in their shares last year constituted                        half of our total market turnover.                        In 2004 alone, 44 Mainland enterprises raised                        funds through listing in                         Hong Kong                        . The vast                        majority of Mainland enterprises listed outside the                        Mainland are quoted on our stock exchange.                        Of those listed in Hong Kong, only a minority are                        also listed in other overseas markets, and more than 70                        per cent of their trading is conducted in                         Hong Kong                        . This                        demonstrates that                         Hong Kong                        has further consolidated its position as the premier                        international capital formation centre for the Mainland."", 's                        | ']"
628,2005,Improving the Financial Regulatory System,"[""27. As an international                        financial centre, one of our major tasks is to provide                        an effective, transparent and fair regulatory regime on                        a par with international standards.                        Last year, this Council enacted the Deposit                        Protection Scheme Ordinance, which will improve the                        protection of deposits in                         Hong Kong                        . The scheme                        is expected to start in 2006.                        We will also introduce a bill into this Council                        next month to implement the new capital adequacy                        standards for banks issued by the Basel Committee on                        Banking Supervision, commonly known as Basel II.                        These new standards will strengthen the                        risk-management capability and stability of our banking                        sector and stand it in good stead for the further                        liberalisation of the Mainland's financial markets in                        future."", 's                        | ']"

We will                        continue to enhance corporate governance so as to                        attract more local and international investors.                        Last year, this Council enacted the Professional                        Accountants (Amendment) Ordinance 2004, which improves                        the transparency and independence of the regulatory                        framework for the accounting profession.                        The amendments include opening up the structure                        of governance of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified                        Public Accountants.                        Later this year, we will be introducing two bills                        which will give statutory backing to major listing                        requirements and establish the Financial Reporting                        Council to strengthen the supervision of auditors and                        raise the quality of financial reporting by listed                        companies.

630,2005,Promoting the Bond Market,"['29. In addition to our                        regulatory work, we will continue to promote our bond                        market. Most                        fund-raising activities in                         Hong Kong                        are now carried out through banking facilities and the                        stock market. This                        means that our bond market has ample room to develop.                        Last May, we issued a $6 billion securitisation                        bond for the government tolled tunnels and bridges. This                        is the largest-ever securitisation bond offering in                         Hong Kong                        , and the first made available to retail investors. It                        also ranks among the largest in the region and has                        received 17 financial                        services awards, including those from Asiamoney,                        FinanceAsia and IFR. In July last year, the                        Government launched its $20 billion global bond                        offering. This                        was the largest dual-currency and multi-tranche offering                        from the region, available to both retail and                        institutional investors.                        It also generated the largest subscription and                        issue amounts for a retail bond offering in                         Hong Kong                        . The                        offering was oversubscribed by local and international                        investors alike, and opened a new chapter for                         Hong Kong                        in the international capital markets.                        It too was the recipient of a number of awards.                        We will consider whether to issue additional                        bonds in future, having regard to our objective of                        promoting the local bond market and the financial                        position of the Government.                        I hope that, as our bond market develops further,                        more corporations and investors from the Mainland and                        overseas will make use of our market to meet their                        funding and investment needs.                        I also look forward to the issuance in                         Hong Kong                        of more bonds denominated in various currencies.', 's                        | ']"
631,2005,Reinforcing our Renminbi Business,"['30. Last year,                         Hong Kong                        became the first place outside the Mainland to conduct                        personal Renminbi (RMB) business, including                        deposit-taking, currency exchange, remittances and                        credit cards. The                        development of this business has been encouraging.                        At present, a total of 38                         Hong Kong                        retail banks, nearly all of them, provide the first                        three of these services.                        As at the end of January this year, total RMB                        deposits in                         Hong Kong                        exceeded RMB13.1 billion.                        The cumulative value of transactions by Mainland                        visitors using RMB cards to spend and make cash                        withdrawals in                         Hong Kong                        exceeds $2.9 billion, or $3,000 per transaction on                        average. Some                        Hong Kong banks also started issuing RMB cards in late                        April 2004 to facilitate cross-boundary spending by                         Hong Kong                        residents.', '31.                        While the range of RMB                        services now available in                         Hong Kong                        is quite limited, the provision of such services already                        represents a breakthrough.                        For the further development of RMB business in                        Hong Kong, I have earlier indicated three strategic                        directions: first, exploring the diversification of the                        RMB assets and liabilities of Hong Kong banks;                        particularly on the liability side, diversification to                        non-residents and non-individuals of deposits now                        restricted to resident individuals; second, exploring                        the provision of appropriate RMB banking services for                        trade and other current account transactions between                        Hong Kong and the Mainland; third, exploring the                        feasibility of establishing a RMB debt issuance                        mechanism in Hong Kong.                        These proposals, if implemented, will facilitate                        the channelling of RMB back to the Mainland and the                        diversification of RMB assets.                        The further development of RMB business in                         Hong Kong                        needs to be compatible with the process of financial                        liberalisation in the Mainland.                        The Government is exploring with the Mainland                        authorities ways to expand the scope of RMB business on                        a sound footing, in these three strategic directions.                        In this context, we will also be studying the                        establishment of a clearing and settlement platform for                        RMB transactions so as to enhance their efficiency and                        safety.', 's                        | ']"

In 2003,                        total assets of our fund management business amounted to                        $2,950 billion, of which $1,860 billion were sourced                        from overseas investors and accounted for 63 per cent of                        the total.

We will shortly introduce the necessary                        legislative amendments into this Council.', '34.                        To promote the further                        development of our asset management business, the                        Government last year consulted interested parties and                        the public at large on the abolition of estate duty.                        While abolition and retention both have their                        pros and cons, the majority view tends to support                        abolition.', '35.                        Those who oppose abolition                        consider that estate duty, which is imposed on the                        better-off in society, is in line with the principle of                        affordability. They                        are also of the view that this duty is not an important                        consideration in investment decisions.                        Some are even concerned about the possible impact                        of abolition on certain professions.                        They have pointed out that, if the duty is                        abolished, the Government will lose a stable source of                        income and suffer a reduction in revenue, and the fiscal                        deficit will be aggravated.', '36.                        Those in support of                        abolition take the view that, although the tax is                        targeted at the better-off, in practice the latter may                        avoid it through various legal means.                        Of the dutiable cases processed by the Inland                        Revenue Department last year, about 70 percent                        involved assets with an estate value, after exemptions,                        below $20 million. They                        point out that, in other places, estate duty avoidance                        is also very common and it is no easy task to plug these                        loopholes. Others                        think that, as the assessment of estate duty takes time,                        and the assets of citizens, particularly operators of                        small and medium enterprises (SMEs), may be frozen                        during the assessment period, this causes them cash flow                        problems. In                        settling estate duty, some enterprises may have to sell                        their assets to raise cash and as a result encounter                        operating difficulties.', '37.                        In recent years, global                        financial services have experienced phenomenal growth.                        The financial markets in the Asia Pacific region                        have also quickened the pace of their development.                                                Hong Kong                        is looking at unprecedented opportunities in this                        sector, but at the same time faces increasing                        competition. A                        number of countries in the region, including                         India                        ,                         Malaysia                        ,                         New Zealand                        and                         Australia                        , have abolished estate duty over the past 20 years.                        In Europe,                         Italy                        and                         Sweden                        have also abolished the tax.                        We understand that one of the main reasons for                        the decision by some countries to abolish estate duty is                        the adverse impact on SMEs.', '38.                        Investment decisions are                        influenced by many factors.                        It is impossible for us to give an accurate                        estimate of the amount of foreign and domestic                        investment that will be induced if estate duty is                        abolished. Nonetheless,                        we believe that, with its abolition,                         Hong Kong                        will become more attractive to investors.                        Many members of the industry envisage that                        abolition will encourage more people to hold assets in                         Hong Kong                        through a corporate vehicle or trust.                        More overseas companies and professionals will                        come here, and this will facilitate the further                        development of our asset management services, create                        more employment opportunities, and in turn make                         Hong Kong                        more competitive as an international financial centre.                        Trading in the financial market will also become                        more active, and contribute additional government                        revenue from stamp duty and other taxes.', '39.                        On balance, after                        weighing these factors, I propose to abolish the tax and                        will introduce the relevant bill into this Council as                        soon as possible.', '40.                        The financial services                        industry is a high value-added industry and very                        important to our economy: its direct contribution is 13percent                        of GDP. The                        industry also fosters growth in a number of professional                        services, and this in turn becomes a strong driving                        force for other sectors, such as real estate and the                        consumer market. With                        globalisation of the industry, the flows of capital,                        financial talent and expertise have become easier and                        more frequent, and have created new opportunities for                         Hong Kong                        . I hope                        that the foregoing measures will encourage the further                        development of our financial services industry and                        strengthen our position as an international financial                        centre.', 's                        | ']"

Our economic restructuring                        and the relocation of manufacturing processes and                        back-office operations have brought tremendous                        employment pressure to bear on the less-educated and                        low-skilled workers.                        Coupled with a slackened construction industry                        and rapid advances in technology, the unemployment rate                        has remained relatively high.                        Because of the nature of the tourism industry,                        its demand for manpower is stronger.                        Thanks to an improved external economy and rapid                        development in the Mainland, there is still plenty of                        room for growth in this sector.                        A boost for the tourism industry can provide a                        large number of low-skilled workers with job                        opportunities and alleviate our unemployment problem.                        We estimate that, during the period from 2000 to                        2003 alone, tourism has created around 25000 new                        jobs in                         Hong Kong                        . The                        Government will continue to spare no effort to support                        and facilitate the development of tourism.', '42.                        Last year, our tourism                        industry performed strongly, with visitor arrivals                        reaching an all-time high of 21.81 million, an increase                        of almost one third compared with 2002, the year before                        the SARS outbreak. This                        boom encouraged growth in tourism-related sectors such                        as the catering, retail and hotel industries.                        In 2004, under the Individual Visit Scheme, 4.26                        million visits were made by Mainland visitors to                         Hong Kong                        . As from                        March last year, the scheme has been extended to the                        whole of                         Guangdong                        Province                        and 11 additional major cities throughout the Mainland,                        and this will further help stimulate our economy.                        Meanwhile, visitor arrivals from our traditional                        long-haul markets increased steadily at a rate of 8 percent,                        breaking the record set in 2002.', '43.                        We expect 2005 to be an                        even better year for the tourism industry.                        Hong Kong Disneyland is scheduled to open in                        September, an event which the market is eagerly                        anticipating, and recruitment of 5000 staff is                        fully under way. By                        the end of this year or early next year, a number of                        other major tourism infrastructure projects will also be                        completed, including the second phase of \ue623 Symphony                        of Lights? the Tung Chung Cable Car System, and                         Hong Kong                        Wetland                        Park                        . In                        parallel, a number of new hotels will have opened by the                        end of 2006, providing about 14000 rooms and                        employment for 7500 staff.                        The Government is also working on strengthening                        the further development of our tourism industry, for                        example, by encouraging ecotourism in the                         Northern                        New                        Territories                        , so that nature lovers may enjoy the natural beauty of                         Hong Kong                        . In                        addition, we are studying the feasibility of developing                        spa resort facilities, which will provide high-spending                        visitors with more choices.', '44.                        Apart from developing new                        attractions, we must make the best use of our tourism                        resources and enhance existing facilities.                        Ever since its opening in 1977,                         Ocean                        Park                        has been a favourite destination for local and overseas                        visitors alike.

We                        all know that plastic waste is generally                        non-biodegradable.

Each                        day the plastic waste dumped in landfills amounts to 1064                        tonnes, equivalent to over 33 million plastic bags.                        Every day on average, therefore, each citizen                        disposes of nearly five plastic bags.                        Such a grave situation is incongruous with the                        concept of promoting a sustainable society.                        ETWB will study ways to help the retail industry                        to minimise the distribution of plastic bags and to                        recover and recycle the used products.

Since the start of the recent bout of operating                        deficits in 1998?9, our fiscal reserves have already                        been depleted by about $170 billion, or 37 per cent.

After reviewing the                        guidelines on operating expenditure which I laid down                        last year, I have reduced estimated operating                        expenditure for 2005?6 by $2.6billion, from                        $210.6billion to $208 billion. This                        reflects the austerity drive by government departments                        and takes into account their actual operational                        requirements.

I                        know that members of the public hope the Government will                        relieve their tax burden.                        However, the suspension of the second phase of                        adjustments would cost the Government $3.3 billion in a                        full year. As                        the fiscal deficit has yet to be eliminated, I believe                        it is inappropriate to adjust the salaries tax rates and                        bands at the current juncture.

Those                        in favour of lowering the duty rate think that this                        would boost consumption, as the rate is higher in Hong                        Kong than in neighbouring jurisdictions such as the                        Mainland and                         Macau                        .', ""96.

According                        to last year's figures, the average retail price of                        the top 10 best-selling wines in                         Hong Kong                        was only $55 per bottle.                        On the contrary, the high-end products that                        attracted a duty above $500 accounted for only about 0.1                        percent by volume of the wine market as a whole,                        an extremely small share.

660,2005,Goods and Services Tax,"['102. Last year I mentioned that                        there was to be a study on the implementation of a goods                        and services tax (GST).                        Suggestions have been made that GST is unfair to                        the grass roots because it is regressive.                        However, there are also people who support the                        introduction of GST on the grounds that it is in line                        with the principle of affordability.                        In general, wealthy people, who have a greater                        capacity to spend, will pay more GST.', ""103.                        I appreciate the                        community's concerns over the introduction of GST.                        But I would like to emphasise that                         Hong Kong                        will continue to maintain the low and simple tax regime                        that underpins our success.                        The purpose of the proposed GST is not to                        increase the grass roots' tax burden.                        The reason for its introduction is to broaden our                        tax base so as to secure a steadier source of revenue                        and reduce our reliance on more volatile revenues.                        As a matter of fact, our salaries tax and profits                        tax, which are the major recurrent revenues of the                        Government, are paid by a minority of taxpayers and                        enterprises, and these taxes are highly sensitive to                        economic fluctuations.                        The problems arising from our narrow tax base are                        abundantly clear. The                        International Monetary Fund has also pointed out that                         Hong Kong                        should introduce GST to solve the problem of its                        structural deficit."", ""104.                        An internal committee set                        up by the Government has carried out the GST study.                        Our next step is to conduct a public consultation                        on this subject. We                        will provide further information in the consultation                        document that we are drawing up for publication later                        this year to give the public a better understanding of                        the tax. Overseas                        experience shows that it takes about three years from                        making a decision to introduce GST to actual                        implementation. Therefore,                        the public will have sufficient time to hold in-depth,                        thorough and constructive discussions on this subject.                        At this stage, there is no need to jump to a                        conclusion. As                        GST will have far-reaching impacts on our tax regime and                        the Government's financial health, we will listen                        carefully to the views of the public."", 's                        | ']"

We have the determination and ability to attain                        our fiscal targets.                        Last year, I pledged to cut spending first and                        reverse the rising trend of operating expenditure.                        With the concerted efforts of my colleagues in                        the various departments, our cost-saving measures are                        now starting to produce results.                        Last year, I said that I would reduce operating                        expenditure to $200 billion by 2008?9.                        This is now forecast to reduce to $201.2 billion                        for 2004?5. I                        said that I would bring public expenditure down to 20                        per cent of GDP or below, and this is forecast to                        decrease to 20.2 per cent next year.                        We expect to achieve balance in the Consolidated                        Account in 2007?8, one year ahead of target.

665,2019,Introduction,"['Mr President,Honourable Members and fellow citizens,', 'I move that the Appropriation Bill 2019 be read a second time.', 'Introduction', '2.This is the second Budget of the current-term Government, my third since I became Financial Secretary. It has been prepared against the backdrop of profound changes in the global political and economic landscape, a complicated and volatile external environment and heightened uncertainties. ', ""3.As a small and totally open economy, Hong Kong has been susceptible to economic headwinds over the past few months, as evidenced by notable slackening growth and diminishing confidence of enterprises in the future outlook. Under such circumstances, it is all the more important for us to have a sound judgement of the prevailing global political and economic landscape, and set the direction for Hong Kong's economic development with due regard to our own strengths. I will take this opportunity to share my views in the Budget. "", '4.Every cloud has a silver lining. Even though we are not out of the woods yet, we have every confidence in our future. ', '5.Given the public and the business community\'s concerns about Hong Kong\'s economic outlook, I prepared this year\'s Budget along the direction of ""supporting enterprises, safeguarding jobs, stabilising the economy, strengthening livelihoods"". In fact, to support the implementation of various measures, including those proposed in the Policy Address, I will provide new resources ready for use of about $150 billion in this Budget, with additional resources earmarked for various purposes. This demonstrates our determination to enhance public services, support enterprises, relieve people\'s burden and invest for the future. Resources will be allocated as appropriate to support these measures. I will provide details in the ensuing parts of my speech. ']"
666,2019,EconomicSituation in 2018,"['EconomicSituation in 2018', ""6.The global economy expanded throughout 2018, with stronger growth momentum during the first half of the year. The momentum was checked by brewing trade tensions and other unfavourable conditions in the second half of the year. Production and trading activities in Asia saw notable growth for most of last year, but significantly weakened towards year end. Affected by the external environment, Hong Kong's total exports of goods had an annual growth of 3.5 per cent in real terms, but the growth in the fourth quarter decelerated, resulting in a slight year-on-year decrease of 0.2 per cent. Exports of services also moderated in the latter half of the year, though an overall growth of 4.9 per cent was recorded for 2018. "", '7.Domestic demand remained largely stable, contributing favourably to the labour market with solid rises in wages and earnings underpinning consumption. Private consumption expenditure grew by 5.6 per cent in real terms for the year, but slowed down through the year amid adjustments in asset prices and increasing external uncertainties. Although investment expenditure registered a growth of 2.2 per cent in real terms for the year, a number of surveys have reflected the weakened business sentiment in Hong Kong recently. ', ""8.Under mounting external pressures, Hong Kong's economic growth moderated from 4.1 per cent in the first half of 2018 to 2.1 per cent in the second half of the year, with growth for the fourth quarter at a mere 1.3 per cent, the lowest since the first quarter of 2016. Overall, Hong Kong's economy grew by 3 per cent in 2018, at the lower end of the range projected in last year's Budget but still higher than the trend growth rate of 2.8 per cent over the past decade. "", '9.The labour market remained tight, with the unemployment rate remaining at 2.8 per cent, the lowest level in more than 20 years. Total employment sustained growth and salaries increased continuously in real terms. ', ""10.As the economic growth had been above the trend growth for two consecutive years, the inflation rate rose slightly in 2018. Netting out the effects of the Government's one-off measures, the underlying inflation rate was 2.6 per cent, up by 0.9 percentage point from 2017.""]"
667,2019,RevisedEstimates for 2018-19,"['RevisedEstimates for 2018-19', '11.The 2018-19 revised estimates on government revenue is $596.4 billion, lower than the original estimate by 1.3 per cent or $8.1 billion. This is mainly due to lower-than-expected revenues from land premium and stamp duties, while revenues from profits tax and salaries tax are higher than the original estimate by $16.1 billion. ', '12.Revenues from stamp duties and land premium have always been highly susceptible to market fluctuations and therefore volatile. The revenue from land premium is $115.9 billion, $5.1 billion less than the original estimate, mainly due to the unsuccessful tendering of two sites in the year. Stamp duty revenue is $80 billion, $20 billion less than the original estimate, attributed to smaller-than-expected trading volumes brought about by adjustments in the property and stock markets over the year. ', '13.As for government expenditure, the revised estimate is $537.7 billion, 5.6 per cent or $31.9 billion lower than the original estimate. This is mainly because the expenditures on certain policy initiatives and public works projects were lower than the original estimates. ', '14.All in all, I forecast a surplus of $58.7 billion for 2018-19. Fiscal reserves are expected to reach $1,161.6 billion by 31 March 2019. ', '15.The civil service establishment increased by 6 700 posts in this financial year, representing a growth of 3.7 per cent, higher than the average growth of one to two per cent over the past decade. One of the main reasons is the additional manpower requirements arising from the commissioning of several boundary control points. ']"
668,2019,EconomicProspects for 2019 and Medium-term Outlook,"['EconomicProspects for 2019 and Medium-term Outlook', '16.Looking ahead for 2019, the global economy, beset with considerable uncertainties and downward pressures, has abruptly turned from synchronised robust growth early last year to the current synchronised slowdown. Market sentiment has become increasingly cautious. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered its global economic growth forecast for 2019 twice in the past five months, from 3.9 per cent down to 3.5 per cent, an indication that the slowdown risks should not be ignored. ', '17.The US economy was affected by an array of factors, such as the escalated trade conflict since the fourth quarter of last year and the normalisation of interest rates, leading to heightened financial market volatility. Economic growth is expected to slow down in 2019. The Brexit deadlock and the lingering risk of a hard Brexit have cast a dim light on the economic performance of the UK post-Brexit. The Eurozone economy has also slackened, with year-on-year growth of only 1.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year and a further weakening in both economic activities and confidence indicators in recent months. ', ""18.In Asia, Japan's economy markedly weakened in the second half of 2018 due to natural disasters and slackened external demand, with a year-on-year growth close to zero. The growth for this year is forecast to be somewhat slow. Meanwhile, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea also saw slower growth momentum. We anticipate that the growth in these high-income economies will remain modest this year. As for India and emerging economies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), although their exports may be constrained by external factors, domestic demand will remain steady and sustain growth in 2019. "", '19.The Mainland economy is also slowing down. A 6.4 per cent growth was recorded in the fourth quarter of last year, with the annual growth rate reducing to 6.6 per cent, close to the full-year growth target of around 6.5 per cent. This year, export growth may further slacken due to external uncertainties. That said, the Mainland has become less dependent on exports in recent years. This, coupled with a host of stimulus measures rolled out by the authorities recently, will help ensure solid economic growth. ', '20.As regards interest rates, the Federal Reserve stated after its Open Market Committee meeting in January this year that it ""would be patient"" in determining future rate adjustments, while pointing out that subsequent rate moves would depend on economic data. Market expectations of interest rates may vary with the economic environment, resulting in greater fluctuations in the financial markets. ', ""21.In fact, these uncertainties have greatly affected investors' risk appetite. The stock markets in the US, the Mainland and Hong Kong dropped significantly within a short time in the past year. The prices of investment products also saw marked fluctuations. "", ""22.The uncertain global economic outlook this year will restrain Hong Kong's economic performance. Having regard to the latest internal and external developments, I will make optimal use of the fiscal surplus for 2018-19 to introduce one-off measures to support enterprises and relieve people's burden. Together with the stimulus effect of other measures in the Budget, I forecast economic growth of two to three per cent in real terms for Hong Kong in 2019. "", ""23.However, should the external headwinds deteriorate, especially if the US-China trade conflict escalates, global trade, investment and financial markets will be subject to greater shocks. This will not only affect our exports and asset markets, but also dampen local investments and private consumption. On the contrary, improving US-China trade relations will help eliminate external uncertainties and may drive better-than-forecast growth for Hong Kong's economy. "", '24.On inflation, the moderate economic growth forecast for this year may reduce the pressure on local costs. Pressure on local rentals eased recently and may also contribute to a lower headline inflation rate. Imported inflation may also be moderated along with the strengthening of the US dollar. Taking various factors into account, I forecast that the headline inflation rate and the underlying inflation rate for 2019 will both be 2.5 per cent. ', ""25.For the medium term, the average growth rate is forecast to be 3 per cent per annum in real terms from 2020 to 2023, slightly higher than the trend growth of 2.8 per cent over the past decade, while the underlying inflation rate is expected to average 2.5 per cent per annum. The above medium-term forecast is made on the assumption that there are no severe external shocks during the period. However, the external environment is still impeded by headwinds. If these headwinds persist in 2020 or beyond or even aggravate, global economic growth will be hindered, and Hong Kong's economy will in turn be affected. We have to stay vigilant.""]"
669,2019,GlobalPolitical and Economic Landscape,"['GlobalPolitical and Economic Landscape', ""26.In last year's Budget, I mentioned three major global trends, namely rising trade protectionism, unstoppable wave of innovation and technology (I&T), and the shift of world economic gravity from West to East. The changes over the past year have unveiled a new situation, new landscape, and new norm of global politics and economics. We must analyse and study these to identify the positioning and future direction of Hong Kong when considering the way forward for our economic and social development. ""]"
670,2019,US-China Relations,"['US-China Relations', '27.First, the US-China trade conflict over the past year has revealed the underlying differences between the two sides, which include technology matters as well as other more deep-seated considerations. While it would be encouraging if the trade issue could be resolved to some extent, their deep-rooted differences may remain. The fluctuating US-China relations may turn the global economy volatile for some time.

Any economic downturn in the major markets will deal a direct blow to these service industries and hence Hong Kong's economic outlook. As such, I believe Hong Kong should endeavour to diversify its economy.

This will inject new impetus into our economy and, at the same time, facilitate our economic restructuring and increase employment opportunities.', ' ', '13.

In the short span of two months since CEPA came into operation, over 300 CEPA certificates of origin have been issued, with the value of products enjoying preferential treatment at around $150 million.', ' ', '14.

This enables professionals and companies in Hong Kong to enjoy the advantage of preferential access to the vast Mainland market.

The 15 expert groups established under the Hong Kong/Guangdong Co-operation Joint Conference have started work in their different areas.  In order to enhance the competitiveness of the Greater PRD, we will strive to improve the economic infrastructure of the region.  The Shenzhen Western Corridor and the new cross-boundary vehicular bridge at the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Control Point, both of which are already under construction, will further facilitate the flow of people and goods between Hong Kong and Guangdong.  The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, which is now under planning, will draw us closer to our hinterland.  Better access to western Guangdong will also help us tap the new business opportunities over there.  The economic co-operation between Hong Kong and Guangdong represents the alliance of a strong manufacturing base with a centre of international finance, trade, shipping, logistics and high value-added services.  The strengths of the Greater PRD region are all-embracing and unique.  With its world-class potential, Hong Kong can play a key role as a business platform.  Our primary task is to seize the opportunities for development that CEPA brings.', ' ', ""20.                                            Such opportunities are not confined to Guangdong alone.

There is already a strong friendship between the people of Hong Kong and Shanghai.

Such people possess expertise and experience as well as better understanding of the Mainland market and its culture.  They will provide valuable assistance in opening up Mainland opportunities.

Up to now, more than 120 countries have introduced this type of tax.  Hong Kong is the only developed economy that does not have one.  GST is broad-based and equitable, and is capable of yielding a sizeable and steady revenue.  According to a rough estimate, each single percentage point in the rate of GST will yield revenue of about $6 billion a year, assuming that no exemption is granted.  Depending on any exemptions, a GST of 5 per cent would generate around $20-30 billion revenue for the Government in a full year.  Besides, being less sensitive than direct taxes to the cyclical movement of the economy, GST can enhance the Government's ability to withstand the pressure on public finances brought about by an economic downturn.

I am indebted to you all, and appreciate fully that various sectors of the community have different needs and aspirations.', ""4.The preparation of this year's Budget has enlightened me in many ways. Budget consultation has revealed once again the wide-ranging, diverse and even conflicting demands within the community. At the same time, it has brought me closer to the public, enabling me to see things from the perspective of the people whom I serve, so that I could consider how best to use the resources pooled from them to meet their needs and those of Hong Kong. Therefore, in preparing the speech, I have placed much emphasis on explaining, in a more systematic way, the Government's priorities in using public resources, as well as our visions for the future, development direction and financial planning."", '5.The initiatives put forward in this Budget are underpinned by three main objectives: (1) Diversified economy: we have to diversify our economy to create wealth for Hong Kong and provide wider and better development opportunities for our young people. (2) Investing for the future: the outbreak of winter influenza has reminded us once again of the pressing need to improve healthcare services; an ageing population poses challenges which need to be overcome by deploying resources and making early preparation; and we also need to improve our living environment to make Hong Kong an ideal smart city to work and live in. (3) Caring and sharing: children and young people should be given more care, protection and opportunities; middle-class families need relief from financial burdens, while the grassroots and underprivileged require more support. Besides, a fulfilling life calls for not only materialistic improvements, but also better quality of life and spiritual enrichment.', '6.In reality, no abundance of resources would ever enable the Government to satisfy the needs of all. It is my responsibility to take care of various sectors of the community. While addressing the pressing needs, I must also be proactive, innovative and bold in investing for the future of Hong Kong. I will elaborate on this in the ensuing parts of my speech.']"
748,2018,EconomicDevelopment,"['EconomicDevelopment', ""7.The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of Hong Kong amounts to US$46,000, and is among the highest in the world. However, our average annual economic growth rate over the past decade was merely 2.7 per cent, reflecting a slower growth momentum. We must leverage our strength and take a forward-looking approach in positioning our future development and seeking new impetus. This will enable our economy to grow in a diversified manner, provide our young people with more room for development and improve people's quality of life.""]"
749,2018,Global Trends,"['Global Trends', '8.In view of the global economic landscape, we need to keep abreast of three major trends and ride on them.', '9.First, the unstoppable wave of innovation and technology (I&T) has swept through the world, fundamentally changing the global economic structure and the way we live and consume. The application and omnipresence of communication technology, artificial intelligence and big data have not only spurred the birth of many new industries that operate across industries, sectors and geographical areas, as well as the emergence of the sharing economy, but also revolutionised the traditional and capital intensive business model based on tangible assets. They have generated keen competition along with opportunities for transformation. New technologies facilitate business start-up and foster new ideas, innovative products and services that generate economic benefits. This explains why major economies over the world all strive to develop I&T and regard it as the new driver of economic growth. To stay ahead of the game, we must enhance our I&T environment, attract companies from new economy sectors and research institutions to set up their presence in Hong Kong and nurture talent for a knowledge-based economy.', ""10.Second, the shift in global economic gravity from West to East is now established. Over the past five years, China has contributed over 30 per cent to the global economic growth and, together with other developing regions in Asia, has made up a share of almost 60 per cent. In the foreseeable future, the developing regions in Asia will continue to drive the global economy. Since the reform and opening up of our country four decades ago, China's economy grew by about 9.5 per cent per annum in real terms on average, and has risen to a US$12 trillion economy last year. Its per capita GDP also increased from just about US$200 in 1978 to over US$8,000 today. The future directions and strategies of our country's economic development have a major global bearing. They are also the linchpin of Hong Kong's sustained prosperity."", '11.Third, since the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008, there have been incessant protests against free trade and calls for de-globalisation in some advanced economies. Protectionism is also on the rise. The multilateral trade system advocated by the World Trade Organization over the past few decades has encountered enormous challenges.

Hong Kong's exports of goods registered appreciable growth of 5.9 per cent in real terms. Exports of services also returned to a steady growth of 3.5 per cent in real terms."", '35.Domestic demand remained particularly resilient.

The International Monetary Fund lately forecast that the global economic growth this year should reach 3.9 per cent, the fastest since 2011. Yet, we need to remain alert to changes in the global monetary environment and geopolitical situations, as well as policy risks of major economies.', '39.The performance of the US economy last year exceeded expectation, with unemployment rate falling below the levels before the financial tsunami. As the US implemented a tax reform at the end of last year, we need to continue monitoring its potential impact on the US and global economy, as well as the capital flows worldwide. The pace of monetary policy normalisation of the Federal Reserve is another major factor affecting the global economic and monetary environment this year.', '40.The recovery momentum in the Eurozone becomes more entrenched as the unemployment rate continues to fall. The policy moves by the European Central Bank following its tapering of monthly asset purchases early this year and the progress of Brexit negotiations deserve attention.', '41.In the Mainland, as it deepens the supply-side structural reform to promote economic upgrading and transformation, and continues to prevent and control financial risks, it is expected to maintain a medium-high rate of economic growth and remain the main engine of global economic growth this year.', ""42.All in all, the prevailing external environment is promising. The expected gradual pick-up in demand from major economies will lead to considerable growth in Asian exports. Hong Kong's exports of goods should be able to grow steadily. If the recovery of tourism in recent months can be sustained, Hong Kong's retail sector will also see a more vibrant performance."", '43.Our favourable employment and income conditions will spur consumption growth in Hong Kong this year. Sanguine local economic sentiment and positive business confidence should also sustain investment growth. In the light of the global and local economic situations at this juncture, I forecast economic growth of three to four per cent for Hong Kong this year.', '44.On inflation, local cost pressures will go up somewhat amid sustained economic growth. Imported inflation will also edge up alongside the global economic upturn, but such pressure is unlikely to be high. Overall, inflation will remain moderate this year. For 2018 as a whole, I forecast that the headline inflation rate will be 2.2 per cent with an underlying inflation rate at 2.5 per cent.', '45.Since the start of this year, the expectation of a US interest rates adjustment has triggered substantial fluctuations in the global financial markets. I urge all investors to stay vigilant. As always, the Government is committed to ensuring an orderly and steady operation of our financial system.', '46.Over the past few years, with a tight supply of residential flats, ultra-low interest rates and an influx of capital, property prices have soared beyond the affordability of ordinary citizens. However, I believe that the key factors underpinning soaring property prices over the past few years are gradually undergoing fundamental changes. First, the supply of residential flats will increase. The private sector will, on average, produce about 20 800 residential units annually in the coming five years (from 2018 to 2022), an increase of 50 per cent over the annual average in the past five years. Besides, as at end-December 2017, the projected supply from the first-hand private residential property market in the next three to four years will remain at a high level of approximately 97 000 units. We anticipate that the tight supply situation in the property market will ease. Besides, as the US interest rate normalisation process continues, the ultra-low interest rate environment of the past few years will no longer persist. The changes in these key factors will put pressure on the property market. The Government will keep a close watch over changes in the property market.

As pointed out in my Budget last year, when considering how our annual surplus is to be deployed, I will carefully take into account the source and nature of the surplus, and make optimal allocation of resources in the light of the external and local economic environment, social needs and public expectations. This year, I will follow the same principle by sharing with the community about 40 per cent of the projected annual surplus, and using the remaining for improving services and investing in the future.', 'Fiscal Reserves', ""52.We have a healthy fiscal surplus, but as a small and highly open economy, Hong Kong is susceptible to changes in the external economic environment. The linked exchange rate system leaves us limited room to adjust our monetary policy. Therefore, healthy public finances are vital for Hong Kong as they enable us not only to accelerate our development and expand our capacity when the economy is stable, but also to introduce counter-cyclical measures promptly and effectively in times of economic downturn, thereby stabilising the economy and safeguarding people's livelihood."", '53.As we all know, Hong Kong has a narrow tax base, and our revenue sources are concentrated. In 2017-18, profits tax, salaries tax, stamp duties and land premium account for about 74 per cent of total government revenue. Among them, land premium and stamp duties fluctuate the most and they account for 27 per cent and 15 per cent of our total revenue respectively.', '54.Fiscal surpluses in recent years were attributable mainly to the buoyancy of asset markets. However, experience shows that asset markets can be highly volatile and any downturn will put our revenue and fiscal position under pressure.', '55.When considering the allocation of resources, I often remind myself to take a more forward-looking perspective. To better care for people in need, the Government has implemented measures proactively for elderly care and support for the disadvantaged over the past few years. In the face of a rapidly ageing population and fierce competitions from other economies, we need to enhance our economic structure, strengthen healthcare and elderly services, nurture talent, increase land supply and housing, improve labour welfare, and build a caring and just society. These are significant commitments.', '56.Moreover, the Budget is prepared on a cash basis and mainly reflects the projected cash receipts and disbursements of the new financial year with forecasts for the following four years. It does not fully reflect our liabilities and committed expenditure, such as the outstanding commitment of over $350 billion for ongoing works projects. Besides, the financial implications of policy initiatives may not be fully reflected in the Budget of the new financial year because of the lead time required for implementation.', 'Relationship between Public Expenditureand GDP', '57.In the past, it was a budgetary criterion that public expenditure should be kept at or below 20 per cent of GDP. One of the considerations was to avoid over-expansion of the Government, which might not be conducive to resource deployment. Today, while acknowledging the forces and roles of the market, we have to be more proactive in managing public finances in the face of various development needs of society and the economy. During the period between the 2018-19 Budget and the subsequent years in the Medium Range Forecast, the public expenditure will be slightly higher than 21 per cent of our GDP, but I will ensure that the increase in public expenditure is necessary to meet the actual needs of Hong Kong, and broadly in line with our affordability in the long run.', '(a)proactively promoting economic development by providing favourable conditions for emerging industries such as I&T and identifying growth opportunities on the one hand, and strengthening the competitiveness of the pillar industries on the other, so that our economy will prosper in a sustained and diversified manner, creating quality jobs for our young people;(b)making bold investments to break through the development bottlenecks.

790,2002,Introduction,"I move that the Appropriation Bill 2002 be read a second time. 2.        This is my maiden Budget.  I feel honoured, but also under some pressure.  Honoured because, under the leadership of the Chief Executive, I can serve the people of Hong Kong by working together with Members of this Council, the community and my colleagues in the civil service to map out the future economic development of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and manage its public finances.  I feel pressured because Hong Kong must overcome the difficulties spawned by the current economic downturn, and because I must address the structural problem of our public finances. 3.        Since I took office ten months ago, the views expressed by our citizens, along with surveys conducted by the media and academic institutions, have consistently indicated that the public are most concerned about how we are going to revive the economy and improve employment prospects.  The public expect me to identify the directions for economic development and to work with the community to sustain our prosperity.  They also expect the Government to introduce further relief measures in this time of economic difficulty. 4.        During this period, I also met with representatives of the local and international financial sectors.  All were most concerned about Hong Kong's fiscal deficit problem.  I am fully aware that, due to the externally-oriented nature of the Hong Kong economy and our linked-exchange-rate system, keeping public finances sustainable is of paramount importance.  The economic crisis in Argentina and the social unrest this has triggered are the results of overborrowing brought about by persistent fiscal deficits and price rigidity.  To safeguard Hong Kong against any such crisis, we must implement effective measures to restore fiscal balance within a reasonable period of time. 5.        As I prepared this Budget, I received many valuable suggestions from Members of this Council and the media.  I also met with members of the public and various sectors, including the financial sector, labour groups and academia.  My heartfelt thanks go to everyone."
791,2002,Economic Performance,"6.        I will begin my analysis with an overview of the economy.  Our economy underwent a downward adjustment in 2001 with a growth of only 0.1% in real terms, much lower than the 10.5% real growth in 2000.  Deflation continued, with the Composite Consumer Price Index falling by 1.6% last year.  In the quarter ended 31 January 2002, the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate rose to 6.7%, its highest since the 1980s."
792,2002,External Economic Environment,"7.        The major economies of the world, including the United States (US), the European Union (EU) and Japan, are all experiencing economic slowdown.  It is the first time since the 1970s that a synchronized global economic downturn has occurred.  The US economy was already showing signs of slowing down by early 2001 and has worsened following the events of September 11.  The EU economy, though slightly better than that of the US, remains sluggish.  Japan has been mired in economic recession for ten successive years.  Under such conditions, Hong Kong's economy is inevitably affected.  Fortunately, the economy of the Mainland of China, the brightest spot in the global economy, has supported ours in this time of economic difficulty. 8.        Initial signs are that economic conditions in the US are improving.  However, the US and other major economies have accumulated massive excess capacity, which can scarcely all be absorbed over a period of a few quarters.  The global economy, in my view, will experience low inflation and low growth for some time to come."
793,2002,Restructuring of the Hong Kong Economy,"9.        In common with other places in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong experienced a bubble economy in the years up to and including 1997.  This was the result of various factors, including the restriction on land supply and the effect of negative real interest rates brought about, against the background of the linked-exchange-rate system, by low interest rates in the US and a high inflation rate in Hong Kong.  Following the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis, this bubble burst. 10.     Meanwhile, globalisation is leading to closer economic ties throughout the world. Increasing trade flows magnify comparative advantages among different areas and accelerate international division of labour.  For Hong Kong, globalisation in general, and integration with the Mainland economy in particular, have thrown down the gauntlet of economic restructuring. 11.     Since the opening up of the Mainland in the 1980s, Hong Kong enterprises, leveraging the low costs there, have expanded their scale of production and enhanced their competitiveness.  Our domestic economy has upgraded itself in tandem.  Support services for Hong Kong and the Mainland replaced manufacturing industries as the fastest-growing sector.  The South China region has now evolved into one of the world's most important production bases.  Since the mid-1990s, service industries on the Mainland have also been developing apace.  During this period, the bubble economy emerged in Hong Kong, giving rise to high operating costs here.  Some Hong Kong service industries started to move northwards as well.  Moreover, after reunification, Hong Kong residents, in increasing numbers, travel across the boundary to spend, affecting Hong Kong's domestic consumption. 12.     In the process of economic integration, the price differential between Hong Kong and the Mainland will inevitably narrow gradually.  In economics, this is called ""factor price equalisation"".  The price of tradable products adjusts swiftly due to relatively free trade between the two places.  The adjustment of non-tradable factors such as land and labour is slower. ""Factor price equalisation”, however, does not mean that price levels between Hong Kong and the Mainland will be exactly the same, just as New York, London and Tokyo have relatively higher prices than their neighbouring areas.  We can foresee that prices in Hong Kong will generally remain higher than those in the Mainland.  The magnitude of this price differential will hinge largely on our ability to provide high-value services and goods. 13.     As the bursting of the bubble economy coincided with economic restructuring, Hong Kong has experienced heavy deflationary pressure.  Property prices have dropped from their peak by more than half.  Labour costs are being trimmed through pay reductions and layoffs. 14.    In the face of persistent deflation, there are some who have suggested abolition of the linked-exchange-rate system.  I must reiterate that the Government has no intention of making any change."
794,2002,Hong Kong's Competitive Advantages and Challenges,"15.     As we undergo economic restructuring, we must consider what are our strengths and play to the best of them. 16.    Our strengths lie in the following four areas -first, our geographic location. Hong Kong is at the centre of Asia. Our hinterland, the Mainland, is the fastest-growing economy in the world.  Other cities cannot claim this advantage; second, our institutional strengths.  These include ""One Country, Two Systems"", the rule of law, a level playing field, clean government, the free flow of information, a simple and low tax regime, and an efficient and effective market-regulatory system. These institutional strengths, developed over many years, have deep roots; third, our talent.  Hong Kong is rich in talent in fields such as business, management, and professional services, as well as some aspects of scientific research and education.  These individuals are biliterate and trilingual, and familiar with both Chinese and Western cultures, management, business operations, mindset and practices; andfourth, our strong business base.  Over the years, many leading enterprises have built up a strong presence in Hong Kong.  They complement and support each other, and create a clustering effect that helps attract more high-value-added business activities to Hong Kong. 17.    But several challenges also confront our economy -
first, our costs are relatively high so we need to develop high-value-added businesses; second, we need to upgrade the quality of our manpower further and increase the number of talented individuals, to meet the needs of our changing economy; and third, we need to enhance economic ties with our neighbouring region, particularly the Mainland, to maintain Hong Kong's status as a regional financial and commercial centre."
795,2002,Moving up the Value Chain,"18.     Since our costs are higher than those of our neighbours, low-skilled and labour-intensive industries are no longer competitive.  Hong Kong cannot rely on them to provide the impetus for economic development.  We need to focus on high-value-added economic activities.  High added value is not the same as high technology.  High-value-added activities exist in every sector.  Of the many economic sectors in Hong Kong, I believe four are of particular importance, as they can foster the development of other sectors, give impetus to our economy, and create employment.  These four areas are financial services, logistics, tourism and producer and professional services."
796,2002,Financial Services,"19.     As an international financial centre, Hong Kong has a considerable edge.  We are renowned for our business in foreign exchange, securities and banking.  To develop further, our financial market needs to concentrate on two important areas. 20.     The first is to increase liquidity.  The Government will work together with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited and the financial services sector to attract more financial product issuers to Hong Kong, as well as capital and investors from the Mainland and overseas.  We are now streamlining procedures and lowering associated costs for the issuance of financial products, so as to facilitate market development and the introduction of new products.  For example, we are simplifying procedures for retail bond issues, and reviewing issuance and listing fees for derivatives. 21.     Second, we need to enhance our market system further.  We will continue to modernise our financial system and make it more user-friendly for investors, issuers and intermediaries through regular reviews.  We will ensure efficient and effective regulation in line with international standards in order to maintain our edge in the region.  The Securities and Futures Bill, which is in its final legislative stage, will introduce a series of measures to streamline the licensing system for intermediaries, increase market transparency, maintain a level playing field and facilitate product innovation.  When preparing the associated subsidiary legislation, we will continue to consult the public and the industry to ensure that such legislation is user-friendly."
797,2002,Logistics,"22.     Hong Kong's logistics industry enjoys many advantages.  We have the world's busiest container port, which handled nearly 18 million TEUs (twenty-foot-equivalent units of containers) last year.  The volume of international freight handled at Hong Kong International Airport was also the highest in the world, last year amounting to nearly 2.1 million tonnes.  The further development of our logistics industry depends on increase in speed and efficiency, as users often value these attributes more than cost.  In this respect, thanks to the efforts of the freight transport sector, the Airport and the government departments concerned, the transshipment time through Hong Kong of cargo shipped from the rest of the world to the Pearl River Delta has been reduced from two days to less than 24 hours.  Moreover, Phase 2 extension works at Lok Ma Chau Control Point are in full swing.  The Shenzhen Western Corridor, targeted for completion in 2005, is also under active planning, and upon completion will increase the capacity for vehicular cross-boundary trips by 44 000 a day.  Apart from enhancing infrastructure, the Government is re-engineering the customs process to speed up clearance, for instance by introducing ""one-stop""  arrangements on a trial basis for trucks crossing via Lok Ma Chau Control Point.  The Logistics Development Council is studying the use of information technology to establish a common platform to facilitate data exchange among participants in the logistics industry, including consignors, transport companies, the Customs and Excise Department, banks and container terminal operators. 23.     To foster the further development of our logistics industry, we have to expand Hong Kong's cargo catchment area and we will encourage logistics services providers to do so.  We also need to develop high-value-added logistics parks in order to attract enterprises to use Hong Kong to support low or even zero-inventory modes of production in the region."
798,2002,Tourism,"24.     Last year, over 13.7 million visitors came to Hong Kong, with those from the Mainland registering strong growth of over 17%.  With the rebound of tourism in Asia, Hong Kong will remain the first choice for many.  To promote tourism, we must develop more attractions and improve our facilities.  We must also develop different types of tourism, such as business tourism linked with exhibitions and conferences, and family, ecological and cultural tourism. 25.     In addition to our existing first-class convention and exhibition facilities, we plan to build a new international exhibition centre at the Airport.  Upon its completion, this new facility will attract many more business visitors to Hong Kong.  Meanwhile, Ocean Park is introducing new attractions, and the construction of Hong Kong Disneyland is progressing well.  These theme parks, as well as the proposed Tung Chung cable car project on Lantau Island, will help cater for family tourism.  Hong Kong is endowed with scenic country parks, hiking trails and nature conservation areas.  They provide a good foundation for the development of ecotourism.  We are also well-equipped to promote cultural tourism.  As the city where East meets West, Hong Kong has attractions as diverse as Temple Street and Lan Kwai Fong, or Wong Tai Sin Temple and Murray House, which form strong and colourful contrasts.  The concept plan for an exciting new cultural zone in West Kowloon has been selected through international competition.  We will soon start detailed planning for its early construction, to provide new attractions for local residents and tourists alike.  Alongside these, we have one of the greatest attractions of all: our fine cuisine.  China has a venerable culinary tradition and Hong Kong enjoys a reputation as a gourmet paradise.  We need to make every effort to retain that accolade. 26.     Together we must welcome our visitors with hospitality, courtesy and sincerity.  I am pleased to note that improvements are taking place.  Every citizen, shop and restaurant is a Tourism Ambassador for Hong Kong.  We must give our guests a value-for-money experience so that they will all want to come back again, and tell their relatives and friends that Hong Kong is a uniquely vibrant and charming destination. 27.     Promoting inbound tourism does not merely bring economic benefits: it also helps us to rediscover Hong Kong's attractiveness.  Tourism enriches the flavour of Hong Kong, and encourages us to cherish our heritage and develop our cultural traditions."
799,2002,Producer and Professional Services,"28.     Another force driving economic development is producer and professional services.  As the Mainland, our hinterland, opened up, this permitted our industries to expand their production base and increase their competitiveness.  In this process, our industries have moved up the value chain, from a low-value-added and labour-intensive production mode to a high-value-added and technologically-based one.  That is why we have, in recent years, witnessed rapid expansion in producer services such as import and export, transportation and warehousing, trade financing, insurance, accreditation and testing, research and development, product design and market research and promotion.  In addition, Hong Kong has a steadily-growing professional services sector, including legal, accounting, engineering, advertising, consultancy, public relations and design services, which provide services to clients in Hong Kong, the Mainland, and throughout the world. 29.     To advance further up the value chain, enterprises in Hong Kong need to devote more resources to research and development, become more innovative and make wider use of technology, especially information technology, to add value to their services.  Such research and development work includes helping the manufacturing industry to introduce more sophisticated and efficient production techniques to enhance productivity and competitiveness.  One way is by accelerating the evolution of the production mode from Original Equipment Manufacturing to Original Design Manufacturing and thence Original Brand Manufacturing by means of design and product innovations and use of new materials.  Such activities can generate many other high-value-added industries and businesses, for example the design of integrated circuits. 30.     We have set up steering committees to promote development in each of these four important economic sectors.  I have been overseeing their work personally and will see to it that good progress is made.  In Hong Kong, there are many other industries with good potential, such as applied technology, Chinese medicine, film, music, publishing, fashion and construction.  Their concerted efforts will give further impetus to our economy."
800,2002,Local Community Economy,"31.     Apart from the more externally-oriented economic sectors that I have just mentioned, economic activities in the local community closely linked to our daily life are also important.  This local community economy covers a wide range of activity, including cultural, recreational, sports, social and personal services; and there are many different types of players, such as small traders, local domestic helpers and fitness instructors.  Development of the local community economy can promote domestic consumption, create employment opportunities and highlight Hong Kong's unique characteristics.  I will chair an inter-bureau working group to promote the development of the local community economy."
801,2002,Quality Speed and Creativity,"32.     Everyone in Hong Kong, whatever his or her particular walk in life, must seek to excel.  Being ahead of the game helps to improve economic efficiency and increase market share.  It also assists us to overcome our higher costs, and allows us to maintain and enhance our standard of living.  We already command a leading position in the region in fields such as financial services, logistics, tourism and pop culture.  We have to keep up this good work to stay ahead of the competition.  In other areas where we enjoy competitive advantages but have not yet taken a lead, we must work harder to reach that goal. 33.     The key to success in business is either a competitive price or product differentiation.  With our cost, we have to use the latter.  This calls for market-driven, customer-oriented services and products delivered or made with quality, speed and creativity.  Such attributes are essential for both high- and low-technology industries.  Let me cite a few examples by way of illustration.  Our restaurants enjoy worldwide renown for their quality and creativity: Hong Kong cuisine is now a synonym for fine dining.  Our pop music and movies are now in demand throughout Asia, another example of success through creativity.  Our garment industry is distinguished by speed and quality.  I believe all of us, irrespective of age, occupation or academic qualifications, and all our businesses, regardless of scope or scale, can harness these attributes of quality, speed and creativity."
802,2002,Nurturing and Attracting Talent,"34.     Hong Kong has good human resources, but we still need to train and attract more talent.  That is the second challenge we have to overcome. 35.     We are now taking action on two fronts.  The first is to improve the quality of our basic education, enhance higher education and promote lifelong learning in the community.  We need more talented individuals who are biliterate and trilingual, innovative, adaptable and have the ability to think critically and communicate.  Indeed, most people in Hong Kong strive to improve themselves and enhance their personal worth.  The Government will continue to invest heavily in education and training and help those in financial difficulties to pursue further studies through subsidies and loans.  Nevertheless, it is also reasonable for those who can afford it, to pay their own expenses in the pursuit of lifelong learning. 36.     The second important task is to attract to Hong Kong individuals with the right knowledge and skills or who have entrepreneurial spirit.  Some believe that the admission of outside talent would deprive local people of employment.  The reality is quite the opposite.  Outside talent gives impetus to our economic development and this in turn creates more jobs.  The keen competition among the developed economies in America and Europe for talent from all over the world is a testament to this. 37.     Whether such talent is prepared to come to Hong Kong depends on many factors, including the living environment, town planning, potential for self-fulfillment and cultural diversity.  But the crucial element is the Government's admissions policy.  Last October, the Chief Executive announced in his Policy Address that the Government was reviewing its immigration policy with a view to relaxing restrictions on the entry of overseas investors.  He has recently suggested the need to conduct a comprehensive study of Hong Kong's admissions policy.  These initiatives are intended to facilitate the steady economic restructuring of Hong Kong."
803,2002,Fostering Economic Flows between Hong Kong and its Hinterland,"38.     As a regional financial and commercial centre, Hong Kong must maintain a smooth flow in both directions of economic activity with its neighbouring areas, in particular the Mainland.  Our interaction with other economies generally does proceed smoothly.  With the Mainland, however, the flows, in particular those of people, goods, capital, information and services, still need improvement.  This is the third challenge we face. 39.     As regards the flow of people, the quota system for the Hong Kong Group Tour Scheme was abolished on 1 January this year, following discussions between the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Central People's Government.  There are now 67 Mainland travel agencies organising tours to Hong Kong, as against four in the past.  The Central People's Government has also simplified the procedures for Mainland visitors to come to Hong Kong on business. 40.     I have already touched upon the subject of goods and capital flows earlier in my speech.  In the field of information, Hong Kong is the telecommunications and broadcasting centre for the region.  We have readily-available information on economic developments in the Mainland. We are the natural base for analysts and investors interested in China.  This creates a clustering effect.  We need to reinforce our advantage in the field of information through upgrading both hardware and software. 41.     As for services, the Government will continue to promote closer connections between these industries in both places.  Our professional services, such as accounting and banking, have gained a foothold in the Mainland.  I am now holding discussions with officials of the Central People's Government on a Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement with the Mainland.  Such an arrangement will greatly enhance the flow of goods and services between the two places."
804,2002,Economic Role of the Government,"42.     Let me now turn to the Government's role in the economy.  I am a firm believer in market economy.  I believe the market can allocate and utilise resources more effectively and has greater capacity to foster creativity, provide economic impetus and create employment opportunities.  Some may have the impression that, to maintain Hong Kong's economic freedom, the Government should be passive and distance itself from the economy.  I disagree.  I am of the view that the Government should have a clear vision of the direction of economic development and be a proactive market enabler.  This role includes - first, maintaining an institutional framework conducive to market development, including reinforcing our institutional strengths, such as the rule of law, the low and simple tax regime, the level playing field, law and order and the business-friendly environment.  The Government should review the regulatory and supervisory framework at regular intervals to ensure that it remains user-friendly, effective and up-to-date; second, providing that infrastructure in which the private sector will not invest; third, providing an appropriate environment and the resources required to raise the quality of our human capital.  That includes investing in education and attracting outside talent to Hong Kong; fourth, securing more favourable market access for our local enterprises through multilateral and bilateral economic and trade negotiations and participation in relevant economic and trade organisations.  The Government in conjunction with the appropriate organisations should also assist local enterprises to promote their products outside Hong Kong; and fifth, considering the need to take appropriate measures to secure projects beneficial to our economy as a whole when the private sector is not ready to invest in them. 43.     Apart from the foregoing, the Government should also provide a ""safety net"" for the community.  While economic activities are the lifeline of society, a caring community based on mutual concern and support is equally important.  The Government will continue to take care of the basic needs of those who are disadvantaged or in hardship.  Their well-being will not be neglected."
805,2002,Economic Prospects for 2002 and the Medium Term,"44.     I now turn to the economic forecast for 2002 and our medium-term (from 2002 to 2006) prospects.  I believe that the EU and US economies will recover in the foreseeable future and that the Mainland will maintain its high economic growth.  In the light of the more favourable external factors and our sustained efforts to move up the value chain, the outlook for Hong Kong is bright in the medium and long term. 45.     I am forecasting a GDP growth of 1% in real terms for 2002, and real trend growth of 3% over the medium term.  As the excess capacity within the global economy has yet to be digested and local deflationary pressure will remain, I forecast a fall of 1.5% in the GDP deflator for 2002 and 0.4% trend growth over the medium term. 46.     While the medium- and long-term outlook is promising, it will take time for our economy to recover.  Economic restructuring will continue for some time.  In the light of these factors, coupled with the pressure of deflation, I expect that, in the short term, the unemployment rate will increase further."
806,2002,Public Finances,"47.     As in the past, the Government will continue to follow the guiding principle of prudent management of public finances.  Article 107 of the Basic Law stipulates that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall follow the principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues in drawing up its budget, and strive to achieve a fiscal balance, avoid deficits and keep the budget commensurate with the growth rate of its gross domestic product. 48.     Two weeks ago, the Task Force on Review of Public Finances published its findings.  The Task Force concluded that our public finances are confronted with structural problems.  On the revenue side, consolidation in the property market has resulted in a structural diminution in revenue from land premiums, profits tax from the banking and property sectors, and stamp duty on property transactions.  The investment income from our fiscal reserves will also suffer a structural reduction, as successive years of fiscal deficits result in a rundown of the reserves, and as the anticipated rate of return on investment income is likely to drop alongside low inflation in the years ahead. 49.     On the expenditure front, the Task Force pinpointed price rigidity in government expenditure, which is particularly severe in times of deflation.  Over the past three years, the general price level of the economy1 has fallen by 12%, whereas the price of government expenditure2 has remained basically unchanged.  Furthermore, our ageing population will increase the demand for social security payments.  In the recent years of economic downturn, the Government has also consciously embraced counter-cyclical fiscal policies.  As the economy recovers, measures to redress these will have to be taken.  Otherwise, our fiscal policies would be out of line with the economy, and this would exacerbate the structural problem in our finances. 1             Price changes in the economy refer to the GDP deflator. 2             Price changes in government expenditure refer to the Government Consumption Expenditure deflator. 50.     The Task Force was of the view that, were the prevailing revenue and expenditure policies to continue, the Government would face ongoing and persistent fiscal deficits.  It estimated that the fiscal reserves would be depleted by 2008-09.  Obviously, this scenario is unacceptable. 51.     Later on, I will propose measures to restore fiscal balance.  Let me first discuss four issues concerning the management of public finances, namely public expenditure as a share of the economy, basis for comparison of growth in expenditure and the economy, consolidated and operating balances, and purpose and level of fiscal reserves."
807,2002,Share of Public Expenditure in the Economy,"52.     The share of public expenditure3 in the economy4 averaged around 16% in the mid-1980s, about 17% in the mid-1990s, but rose to 22% in 2001-02.  This is due to the fact that, in the face of economic downturn since 1998, the Government has consciously adopted a counter-cyclical fiscal policy, by keeping expenditure growth above the trend growth of the economy.  In addition, due to rigidity in the prices of public expenditure, they have continued to rise despite deflation in the economy. 3             Public expenditure comprises government expenditure and expenditure by the Trading Funds, the Housing Authority and payments from the Lotteries Fund.  Government expenditure accounts for the majority of public expenditure. In 2001-02, for example, government expenditure accounts for about 88% of public expenditure. 4             The share of public expenditure in the economy is expressed as a percentage of GDP. 53.     The growing share of public expenditure in the economy consumes scarce resources that could otherwise be used by the private sector more efficiently.  To maintain Hong Kong's competitiveness, we must contain public expenditure as a percentage of GDP.  My target is to reduce this share to 20% of GDP or below by 2006-07."
808,2002,Basis for Comparison of Growth in Expenditure and the Economy,"54.       Government expenditure and economic growth can be measured in both real and money (or nominal) terms.  In a nutshell, our recurrent revenue and expenditure are accounted for in money terms, whereas ""real"" is an economic concept, referring to value after discounting price movement. 55.     Price movement in government expenditure does not follow that of the economy.  This is mainly attributable to the higher wage content of government expenditure.  Wages tend to increase faster than the general price level in the economy, which means that the price of government expenditure grows faster than the general price level.  Government expenditure also includes pension and social security payments, and these have not adjusted downwards with the general price level in times of deflation.  The differential between the government expenditure price level and the general price level thus widens further.  Over the past decade, the government expenditure price level has risen by 72% but the general price level only by 29%.  As a result, although in real terms the growth in government expenditure has been broadly in line with GDP growth, it has overshot in money terms.  From 1998-99 to 2001-02, government expenditure recorded a cumulative growth of 17% in money terms, while GDP registered a cumulative fall of 5%. 56.    As both government revenue and expenditure are accounted for in money terms, I shall strive to control the growth of government expenditure in money terms, in addition to controlling it in real terms."
809,2002,Consolidated and Operating Balances,"57.     Government revenue and expenditure can be measured on two levels.  One is the Consolidated Account, which comprises all revenue and expenditure, including recurrent and capital revenue and expenditure.  The other is the Operating Account, which, put simply, includes only recurrent revenue and expenditure.  It is important to achieve a balance in both accounts, but for investors and international rating agencies, the operating balance sometimes is even more important. 58.     Investment income from the fiscal reserves has been a major source of revenue for the Operating Account, contributing on average 13% in each of the past four years.  This income source is expected to decrease as a result of the declining fiscal reserves and the lower return on their investment.  Accordingly, we should focus not only on the deficit or surplus after taking investment income into account, but also on that before its inclusion.  Let me illustrate this point with reference to daily family financial management.  The recurrent revenue of the Government can be compared to the wage income of a family, the fiscal reserves to a bank deposit, and investment income to interest earnings.  Generally speaking, a family's operating account is balanced when the wage income is adequate to cover its daily expenses.  If a family has to draw on interest earnings to meet its daily expenses, then it has to be very much on the alert because interest earnings, being susceptible to interest rate movements, are not stable.  If its income is insufficient to cover daily expenses and the family has to draw on the principal of the deposit, I am afraid that it will have to survive on debt once the deposit is depleted. 59.     In seven out of the past ten years, the Government has run a capital account deficit.  Capital expenditure is mainly on infrastructural projects, and is principally funded by land premiums.  As Hong Kong's property sector undergoes consolidation, land premiums in future will likely be inadequate to meet capital expenditure.  Although the Government can sell some of its assets, this cannot provide a stable source of revenue in the long term.  Therefore, to ensure consolidated balance, we need to achieve surpluses in the Operating Account over the longer term to finance a part of capital expenditure. 60.     We have had operating deficits for four consecutive years since 1998-99.  In three of the past five years, the Consolidated Account has also recorded a deficit.  This cannot go on forever.  My target is to achieve consolidated and operating balances by 2006-07."
810,2002,Fiscal Reserves,"61.     During my Budget consultations, I heard suggestions for the Government to revise the target level of fiscal reserves in the light of the prevailing conditions of the economy and public finances. 62.     In the wake of the Asian financial crisis, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has implemented a series of measures to reinforce the stability of the Hong Kong Dollar exchange rate.  In addition, the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund has now reached $300 billion.  These developments have greatly enhanced the Exchange Fund's ability to maintain exchange rate stability.  I see no further need to link the level of fiscal reserves to money supply.  In my view, it should be sufficient to have fiscal reserves equivalent to around 12 months of government expenditure to meet operating and contingency requirements.  Although it is no longer necessary to link the level of fiscal reserves to money supply, the Government's fiscal reserves will continue to be placed with the Exchange Fund, thereby providing even more resources for the Exchange Fund to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong Dollar and our monetary system."
811,2002,2001-02 Outturn,"63.     Let me now elaborate on the Government's plan to solve the deficit problem in the medium term.  First, I forecast a consolidated deficit of $65.6 billion for 2001-02 (equivalent to 5.2% of GDP), far larger than the original estimate of $3 billion.  This is due mainly to revenue from land premiums and investment income from our fiscal reserves falling far short of our original forecasts.  Furthermore, the secondary offering of Mass Transit Railway shares originally planned for this financial year has been postponed to the next because of changes in investment market conditions.  I estimate the fiscal reserves to be $369.8 billion by 31 March this year, roughly equivalent to 19 months of government expenditure."
812,2002,Restoring Fiscal Balance Step by Step,"64.   Earlier, I set three targets for our public finances in 2006-07 -first, restore balance in the Consolidated Account; second, attain a balanced Operating Account; and third, reduce public expenditure to 20% of GDP or below. I aim to achieve these targets step by step through reducing the growth of government expenditure and modestly raising revenue.  I believe this is a practical strategy commensurate with our economic condition."
813,2002,Controlling Expenditure Growth in Real Terms,"65.     Having regard to the current state of our economy, I have decided to allow government expenditure in 2002-03 to grow by 2% in real terms over the original estimate for 2001-02, or 7.7% over the revised estimate, higher than the forecast economic growth of 1% in real terms for 2002. 66.     From 2003-04 to 2006-07, I will reduce the real growth in government expenditure to an average of 1.5% each year, lower than the forecast economic growth rate.  I believe Hong Kong's economy should have picked up by then and such a reduction will be necessary to restore fiscal balance in the medium term."
814,2002,Civil Service Pay,"67.     I have mentioned earlier that it is necessary to control the growth of government expenditure in money terms.  Personnel-related expenses account for 70% of government operating expenditure.  Given our serious fiscal position, I have assumed in the Medium Range Forecast, for financial planning purposes, that civil service pay will be cut by 4.75% and the salary-related portions of subventions to the various organisations will also be reduced by the same rate.  This assumed 4.75% pay cut has taken into account the respective cumulative pay rises for civil servants of different ranks since July 1997. 68.     Under the existing mechanism, the Government will consider, among other things, the results of the private sector pay trend survey and its own budgetary position before deciding on an annual civil service pay adjustment.  We will continue to adopt this mechanism and make a final decision after the outcome of this year's survey is known in May.  Any decision on a civil service pay cut needs to go through the legislative process before it can be implemented.  Assuming that the pay cut takes effect from 1 October this year and that the level of reduction is 4.75%, the Government will achieve savings of about $3 billion in 2002-03 and about $6 billion in a full year. 69.     Last month, I met with representatives of the civil service central consultative councils and a number of civil service staff unions.  I appreciate their position.  I believe many colleagues in the civil service and the subvented organisations understand that we are facing a serious fiscal situation and that persistent fiscal deficits will adversely affect Hong Kong as a whole.  In fact, many colleagues told me that they were willing to stand by the rest of the community in this time of difficulty and share the burden."
815,2002,Doing More with Less,"70.     In addition, we will stringently contain the growth of the civil service in all ranks.  Last year, the Government proposed to reduce the civil service establishment to around 181 000.  Thanks to the efforts of all departments and grades, we will achieve this target as scheduled in 2002-03. 71.     We will also review the demand for services and our priorities for the deployment of resources.  Departments will streamline procedures, simplify structures and economise on manpower in order to release resources to meet additional needs.  Furthermore, we will make use of market forces and strengthen our co-operation with the private sector to provide better and more efficient services to the public through various means."
816,2002,Controlling Expenditure Growth in Money Terms,"72.     Assuming that civil service pay is cut from 1 October this year, government expenditure in 2002-03 will increase in money terms by 0.6% over the original estimate, or 6.2% over the revised estimate, for 2001-02.  Average annual growth of government expenditure from 2003-04 to 2006-07 will be 1% in money terms.  With the foregoing measures for controlling expenditure, I am confident that public expenditure will fall to 20% of GDP in 2006-07."
817,2002,Revenue Proposals for 2002-03,"73.     Nevertheless, in order to restore fiscal balance in the medium term, we need to increase revenue in addition to controlling the growth of government expenditure. 74.     Under present economic conditions, I consider it inappropriate to make any major changes on the revenue front in 2002-03.  My only tax increase proposal is a modest increase in the duty rate on wine.  I also propose to reduce the quantities of duty-free tobacco and still wine that local residents may bring back to Hong Kong.  These two proposals have no bearing on livelihood and will not hinder economic recovery."
818,2002,Duty on Wine,"75.     I propose to increase the duty rate on wine from 60% to 80%.  I estimate that this will generate additional revenue of $70 million in a full year.  This proposal will have only a mild effect on the retail prices of wine, as the level of duty is determined on the basis of ex-factory prices.  The new duty rate became effective at 2:30 p.m. today in accordance with a Public Revenue Protection Order signed by the Chief Executive and published in the Gazette.  We will introduce the related legislation into this Council as soon as possible."
819,2002,Quantities of Duty-free Tobacco and Still Wine,"76.     I propose to cut by 40% the quantities of duty-free tobacco that Hong Kong residents may bring back.  The new duty-free quantities will be 60 cigarettes or 15 cigars or 75 grammes of tobacco.  For duty-free still wine, the quantities that Hong Kong residents may bring back will be cut by 25%, from one litre to 750 millilitres, the standard size of a bottle of wine.  I estimate that this proposal will generate additional revenue of about $330 million in a full year."
820,2002,The Shortfall,"77.     With the foregoing measures to control expenditure and increase revenue and the assumed 4.75% civil service pay reduction, we would not yet be able to restore balance in the Operating Account in 2006-07.  We still need to increase recurrent revenue or reduce recurrent expenditure by $2 billion from 2003-04 onwards, with another $3.5 billion required from 2004-05 onwards and a further $3.5 billion from 2005-06 onwards. 78.     To achieve overall fiscal balance in 2006-07, we also need to increase capital revenue (e.g. by the sale of government assets) or reduce capital expenditure by $20 billion over the medium term."
821,2002,Boundary Facilities Improvement Tax,"79.     Having considered the views of various sectors of the community, I propose to introduce a Boundary Facilities Improvement Tax.  Many Members of this Council and citizens agree that it is in principle justifiable to impose a tax at a modest level on passengers departing from Hong Kong through land crossings.  At present, passengers departing through Hong Kong International Airport or people leaving by sea for the Mainland and Macau through our marine ferry terminals are required to pay a flat-rate tax or fixed fee to the Government.  As our economic links with the Mainland strengthen, we will allocate substantial resources to improve our land crossing facilities to remove constraints on the flows of people and trade between the two places.  The collection of a Boundary Facilities Improvement Tax at a reasonable rate will help finance the improvement of boundary facilities. 80.     The Government will look into the details of implementation, including appropriate exemption arrangements, for the Boundary Facilities Improvement Tax.  We aim to introduce a bill into the Legislative Council in 2002-03 so that this tax can come into effect in 2003-04.  Assuming that the Boundary Facilities Improvement Tax is set at $18, it can generate an estimated additional revenue of approximately $1 billion a year. Making Up the Shortfall: the Way Forward 81.    Apart from the Boundary Facilities Improvement Tax, the Government has to consider other options for raising additional revenue or reducing expenditure to make up the shortfall that I mentioned earlier. 82.     As regards increasing revenue, the Advisory Committee on New Broad-based Taxes has recently released its report.  I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Moses Cheng, Chairman of the Advisory Committee, and all its members for their work.  The report's recommendations include the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax and a Land and Sea Departure Tax (akin to the Boundary Facilities Improvement Tax), an increase in rates, and a reduction in personal allowances under salaries tax.  Apart from these recommendations, the Government will consider other options for raising additional revenue.  The Government is considering how to tackle illegal soccer betting more effectively, including options that may bring additional revenue to the Treasury. 83.     I understand the community's concern about the recommendation for a Goods and Services Tax.  The Chief Executive and I have stated clearly that the Government will not introduce such a tax while there is a downswing in the economy.  Nevertheless, the Government will continue to study the details of a Goods and Services Tax for implementation as and when necessary."
822,2002,2002-03 Expenditure Estimates,"84.     Let me now focus on the expenditure estimates for 2002-03.  These estimates have taken into account the assumed 4.75% civil service pay reduction and the corresponding reduction in subventions for salary-related expenses to subvented organisations. 85.     I have earmarked adequate resources to implement the Chief Executive's vision for Hong Kong, including the policies and performance pledges announced in his Policy Address last October. 86.     In 2002-03, total recurrent government expenditure will amount to $204.9 billion, an increase of 5% in real terms over the revised estimate for 2001-02.  Recurrent expenditure for Education is estimated to be $49.3 billion, an increase of 8%; for Health $32.4 billion, an increase of 4%; for Social Welfare $32.1 billion, an increase of 9%; for Support $28.4 billion, a decrease of 2%; for Security $24.8 billion, an increase of 2%; for Infrastructure $11.8 billion, an increase of 4%; for Environment and Food $9.0 billion, an increase of 10%; for Economic $8.8 billion, an increase of 12%; for Community and External Affairs $7.6 billion, an increase of 3%; and for Housing $0.6 billion, a decrease of 1%. 87.     Government capital expenditure in 2002-03 is estimated to be $49.4 billion, representing an increase of 21% in real terms over the revised estimate for 2001-02.  This is due mainly to provisions for setting up the Continuing Education Fund, support for small and medium enterprises and increased spending on capital works.  Expenditure on capital works is estimated to be $28.5 billion, an increase of 15% in real terms over the revised estimate for 2001-02.  From 2003-04 to 2006-07, expenditure on capital works will be in the range of $25 to $30 billion per year, depending on progress of individual projects."
823,2002,Helping the Community Ride Out the Storm,"88.     In the course of Budget consultations, Members of this Council and many citizens expressed the hope that the Government would show concern over the community's hardship in this time of economic difficulty.  The Chief Executive and I both agree that, the Government's overall financial position permitting, we will provide some one-off concessions related to people's livelihood. Reducing Rates Payments 89.     In his Policy Address last October, the Chief Executive decided to ease the burden on all ratepayers by reducing the amount of rates payable in 2002.  The maximum amount to be waived for each rateable tenement is $2,000.  To provide further relief to our citizens, especially middle-income earners, I have decided to raise the maximum amount to $5,000.  The previous concession of $2,000 reduced the load on ratepayers by $5 billion.  With an increase in the concession to $5,000, their burden will be reduced by another $2.6 billion. Reducing Water and Sewage Charges and Trade Effluent Surcharge 90.     I propose to waive water and sewage charges for domestic households for one year, subject to maximum amounts set at $800 and $200 respectively.  As for non-domestic consumers, I also propose to waive their water and sewage charges for one year, subject to maximum amounts set at $3,200 and $800 respectively, so as to help reduce the operating cost of the industrial and commercial sectors.  As some premises still use fresh water for flushing, I also propose to waive such flushing charges for one year, subject to a maximum amount set at $800.  Currently, operators in 30 specified trades are required to pay a trade effluent surcharge.  I propose to reduce this surcharge by a flat rate of 30% for one year.  The foregoing concessions will cost about $1.3 billion. Waiving Business Registration Fee 91.     To help further reduce the operating cost of businesses, I propose to waive the business registration fee for one year.  This proposal will cost about $1.3 billion. Extending Duty Concession for Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel 92.     The duty concession for ultra low sulphur diesel is due to expire on 31 March this year.  In view of the operating difficulties of the transportation industry, I propose to extend this concession, for the third time, for another year to 31 March 2003, maintaining the duty rate of ultra low sulphur diesel at $1.11 per litre.  This proposal will cost $1.2 billion. Freezing Government Fees and Charges 93.     To avoid adding to the burden of the community, I have decided to freeze government fees and charges up to the end of March next year.  However, this measure will not apply to fees and charges levied by trading funds, nor to services provided at full cost to certain public entities.  Nor will it apply to any new fees that are in the pipeline. Summary of Concessions 94.    With the implementation of the above concessions -about 85% or more than 2.3 million ratepayers will pay no rates for one year; about 80% of households and business consumers will pay no water and sewage charges for one year; each of the 15 000 or so businesses currently required to pay the trade effluent surcharge will on average pay $4,000 less over 600 000 business operators will be exempted from the business registration fee for one year; and the transportation industry will continue to benefit from the duty concession for ultra low sulphur diesel. 95.     These extensive concessions will benefit the general public and the business community alike.  The total cost of these concessions will amount to $6.4 billion. 96.     Implementation of the proposed concessions on water and sewage charges, the trade effluent surcharge, the business registration fee and the duty on ultra low sulphur diesel is subject to the passage of subsidiary legislation.  We will introduce the subsidiary legislation into this Council as soon as possible.  I hope that Members will support these proposals. Rates Revaluation 97.     Apart from my proposal to raise the maximum amount of rates to be waived to $5,000 for each rateable tenement in 2002, the recently-completed revaluation exercise has also indicated that average rateable values fell by 6% last October compared with a year earlier.  The burden of rates payments on citizens has thus been further alleviated. Youth Work Experience and Training Scheme 98.     In this time of high unemployment, the lack of jobs for young people aged between 15 and 24 is of particular concern to us.  When the economy is sluggish, as such people generally have little or no working experience, it is difficult for them to secure employment. 99.     To assist them to raise their employment prospects, I have decided to allocate a one-off sum of $400 million for the implementation of a two-year scheme to provide on-the-job training for about 10 000 young people.  Training periods will range from six to 12 months, depending on the needs of individual industries.  During this time, the trainees will acquire knowledge and skills relating to their chosen industry.  Upon completion of their training, they will receive a certificate which will enable them to continue their studies or find employment.  For the period of training, we will provide a monthly subsidy to employers who will be required to pay the trainees’ wages.  We will work out details of the programme with the relevant industries and training institutions.  I urge the business sector to participate actively in the scheme."
824,2002,Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure,"100.     Total expenditure for 2002-03, including the expenditure initiatives which I have announced today and assuming that civil service pay is reduced by 4.75% and subventions to the various organisations are reduced correspondingly, will amount to $259.8 billion.  I estimate that, after implementation of my revenue proposals, total revenue will be $214.6 billion.  The consolidated deficit will be $45.2 billion, equivalent to 3.6% of GDP. The operating deficit will be $62.0 billion before, and $49.3 billion after, inclusion of investment income from the fiscal reserves.  At 31 March 2003, the fiscal reserves are forecast to be $325.6 billion, equivalent to 15 months of government expenditure. 101.     When all the foregoing expenditure-control and revenue-raising measures are implemented and when we have taken further measures to make up the shortfall as targeted, the Government's fiscal position5 will be as follows - 102.     The Government will achieve operating and consolidated balances in 2006-07, at which time the fiscal reserves are forecast to be $271.2 billion, equivalent to 12 months of government expenditure."
825,2002,Concluding Remarks,"103.     It has been my great honour to lead the preparation of this Budget.  Over the past 30 years, I have often travelled on business.  Whenever I was away, however, I longed to return to Hong Kong, my home town.  In Hong Kong we have the wonton noodle, ""daipaidong"" tea, and noisy but lively tea houses. Also, the night scenes that surround our harbour are so colourful, dazzling and enchanting and can be found in no other place in the world.  So many lights.  I see each light as a symbol of the energy and brilliance of this great city. 104.     We have all grown up in Hong Kong.  Many of you may still remember the days of water rationing, when we had to queue up in the street, bucket in hand, waiting for our turn, and the times when the whole family had to assemble plastic flowers or put stickers on toys to make ends meet.  We have moved on past all those times now. 105.     Hong Kong is a vibrant and dynamic place.  With determination and hard work, we can achieve our goals.  The Hong Kong that we treasure is caring, full of mutual respect, very free and a great believer in diversity.  Today we are in the rough.  It is high time for all of us to pitch in.  I believe that this is the wish of Members, my government colleagues, the media and citizens outside this Chamber.  In these difficult times, I see many people rising to the challenge, working harder and holding their heads up high.  I am confident that we will scale new heights. 106.     Compared with so many other places, Hong Kong has a promising future.  This is founded on the strength and prosperity of our hinterland.  Since reunification in 1997, we are no longer separated from our motherland by an accident of history.  With the implementation of ""One Country, Two Systems"", Hong Kong has returned to her embrace.  We will continue to help build our nation.  Hong Kong has always been an energetic, free, liberal and enterprising city.  History made us the pearl of the convergence between East and West.  As we forge ahead, we have a special role to play at the vanguard of our motherland's integration with the rest of the world. 107.     I look forward to working with Members of this Council, my government colleagues and the whole community, to revitalise our economy and to contribute to Hong Kong and our nation. 108.                   In closing, I would like to share with you the following lyrics6 - Of one mind in pursuit of our dream All discord set aside With one heart on the same bright quest Fearless and valiant inside Hand in hand to the ends of the earth Rough terrain no respite Side by side we overcome ills As the Hong Kong story we write."

864,2003,Introduction," I move that the Appropriation Bill 2003 be read a second time. 2.       Charles Dickens once wrote, ""It was the best of times; it was the worst of times"".1 This phrase is an apt description of Hong Kong's present situation. The world, with war imminent in the Middle East, faces major uncertainties. In Hong Kong, the unemployment rate persists at a high level, and job losses remain a worry. The psychological and material impacts of negative equity have suppressed demand for consumption and investment. The public has yet to recover its confidence in the future of our economy and vents its dissatisfaction at the Government. It is, if you will, the worst of times. In contrast, the Mainland's economy is growing rapidly, and investors worldwide compete for a share in her markets. Hong Kong, as the most cosmopolitan commercial city in China and the region, possesses geographical and institutional advantages. As the economy has been restructuring over the past five years, Hong Kong has seen a substantial reduction in the cost of doing business, and this has enhanced our competitiveness. Exports of goods and services again show growth, and tourism continues to flourish. Our citizens have gradually come to realise the inevitability of change. As the Chinese saying goes, ""from need to change, from change to solution"". To renew our strengths and set a new course, this could well be the best of times.
1 Extracted from A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. 3.       Against such a background, the preparation of this year's Budget has put me in a dilemma. Prudent fiscal management is not simply a matter of balancing the books, but also the interests of various sectors of the community. Cutting expenditure will inevitably affect civil service colleagues. Public expectations of the level of government services will have to be adjusted as well. Raising revenue will increase the burden on taxpayers and thus opposition from the community. 4.       My task is clear: not only to manage public finances properly, but also to propose measures aimed at implementing the plan for economic development and improving people's livelihood mapped out by the Chief Executive. 5.       For us to forge ahead, the Government needs to work together with the people, united in determination and with wisdom to meet all challenges, turning adversity into opportunity."
865,2003,Economic Performance,"Hong Kong's economy is on an upward trend. Economic growth in real terms picked up significantly, rising from 0.6% in 2001 to 2.3% in 2002, with the main impetus coming from robust growth in exports of goods and services. Nevertheless, deflation has been more serious than we expected, as evidenced by a drop of 3% in the Composite Consumer Price Index and 2.7% in the general price level of the economy as measured by the GDP deflator. As deflation persisted, local consumption and investment remained weak. The nominal rate of economic growth fell by 0.6% for the whole year, about the same level as forecast last March."
866,2003,Fiscal Deficit,"7.       Though the economy has shown signs of improvement in real terms, the Government's huge fiscal deficit, if not resolved early, will dampen investors?confidence and stifle economic recovery. The consolidated deficit for 2002-03 is forecast to be $70 billion, $24.8 billion more than the original estimate. This is mainly because government revenue is 19.2% less than originally estimated. Capital revenue is forecast to be $29.1 billion less than the original estimate. This substantial decrease is related to the Government's announcement in November last year to suspend land sales for one year, which has resulted in a $13.9 billion drop in land revenue against the original estimate. Additionally, the Government is studying a merger of the two railway corporations and has postponed the sale of the second tranche of MTR Corporation shares, reducing revenue by a further $15 billion. 8.       The fact that capital revenue fell short of expectations has no doubt aggravated the deficit but the problem emerged well before this financial year. In four of the past five years, the Consolidated Account registered a deficit. That for 2002-03 amounted to 5.5% of GDP. The Operating Account, which reflects government day-to-day revenue and expenditure, has been in deficit five years in a row, and this has been increasing at an astonishing rate. Excluding investment income from the fiscal reserves, the operating deficit hit $67.6 billion in 2002-03, equivalent to 5.3% of GDP."
867,2003,Causes of our Fiscal Deficit,"The persistent problem of huge deficits is a reflection of four changes that Hong Kong is facing: cyclical economic adjustment; economic restructuring; population ageing; and evolution of government policies. 10.    The impact of cyclical economic adjustment is mainly reflected in the consolidation of the property market and the bursting of the bubble economy, which have resulted in substantial decreases in revenues generated directly and indirectly from real estate activities. 11.    As for economic restructuring, the continuing expansion of the regional economy centred in southern China is greatly enhancing the mobility of production and services. Quite a few of Hong Kong's economic activities have shifted outwards. The majority of our industrial production processes have moved across the boundary in the past 20 years. Hong Kong's import and export trade, once dominated by domestic exports, has become re-export-led, and its development is marked by a recent shift towards offshore trade. Our service industries have also gradually expanded outwards. In the face of challenges brought about by economic restructuring, the Government is pursuing policies that help to increase external demand and promote the development of high value-added industries. Because Hong Kong has a territorial-based tax system, economic restructuring has a profound impact on our public finances. 12.    The ageing population has also brought challenges to our public finances. Over the past decade, the percentage of persons aged 65 and above has increased from 9% of the population to 11%, and is forecast to rise to 24% by 2031. An ageing population will lead to an increase in government expenditure on social welfare and health services. The declining proportion of the population in the workforce will also result in reduced revenue. 13.    The fourth development is the evolution of government policies. The services provided by the Government over the past decade have improved in both quality and quantity. In addition, due to rigidity in the pay adjustment mechanism for the Government and subvented organisations, the increase in unit costs has been greater than that of the price level in the overall economy. As a result, over the past decade, public expenditure in money terms has increased by an annual average of 8.3%, which is higher than the 4.9% annual average nominal economic growth over the same period. The share of public expenditure in the economy has increased from 15.6% to 21.5% for this year. There has been substantial growth in public expenditure in the major policy areas: 14.    Moreover, the Government has reduced taxes, fees and charges several times in recent years. Revenue from various government fees and charges, as a percentage of total government recurrent expenditure, has decreased from 18% to 6% over the past decade. 15.    Against the background of regionalisation and an ageing population, and as high levels of wages and welfare are no longer supported by high land prices, a structural fiscal deficit is inevitable. 16.    We have studied these issues in recent years. In February last year, the Task Force on Review of Public Finances submitted its report on the structural problems of our public finances. At about the same time, the Advisory Committee on New Broad-based Taxes published its report on widening the tax base. The report explored the relationship between direct and indirect taxes and our public finances, and recommended, inter alia, introduction of a Goods and Services Tax when appropriate. 17.    Considering the characteristics of Hong Kong's economy and its past trends, we believe that the principles of ""big market, small government"" and low taxation are the cornerstones of Hong Kong's development. Last year, I proposed to contain public expenditure to 20% of GDP or below. Besides controlling public expenditure, the Government also considers that it is necessary in the long term to introduce a Goods and Services Tax to broaden the tax base and secure a stable source of public revenue. In view of the present economic situation, we will not introduce such a tax for the time being. We will continue to study details for future implementation. 18.    Since the problem of a huge fiscal deficit is serious and needs to be addressed immediately, the Government must propose specific measures to eliminate it."
868,2003,The Urgency of Solving the Deficit Problem,"19.    Some commentators claim that, as Hong Kong is undergoing economic restructuring and has been suffering from deflation and high unemployment for consecutive years, the Government should, given its fiscal reserves, reduce taxes and increase public expenditure to stimulate the economy, thus solving the problem of the fiscal deficit. I disagree. The European Union (EU) requires its member states to contain their fiscal deficit within 3% of GDP. Though the United States (US) is facing a huge deficit, the total amount will not exceed 3% of its GDP either. In contrast, our fiscal deficit is as high as 5.5%. If the situation continues deteriorating, it may lead to an outflow of capital, thus pushing up interest rates. It will also impede the trend of economic recovery and could even trigger a financial crisis. 20.    Many economists and international financial institutions have commented that the fiscal deficit poses potential problems for Hong Kong's economy. In its annual visit last month, a delegation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) observed that ""the continued deterioration of the fiscal position has made it the main source of potential macroeconomic vulnerabilities"". The IMF called on the Government to formulate ""a well-specified deficit reduction plan to bolster market confidence. Despite the uncertain macroeconomic outlook, credible fiscal consolidation has to begin in fiscal year 2003. This will require the implementation of sizeable structural deficit reduction measures in fiscal year 2003 and a commitment to more substantial consolidation, supported by concrete measures, in the next three years."" 22 Refer to the IMF delegation's Concluding Statement for the Article IV Consultation with the People's Republic of China in respect of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in February 2003. 21.    The Government has repeatedly stressed that the problem of the fiscal deficit has to be solved with a three-pronged approach, namely boost the economy, cut expenditure and raise revenue. There is general support in the community for this. Economic growth is a key to solving the problem. Failure to find a decisive solution will in turn stifle economic development. The two are interactive. 22.    As Hong Kong's economy is externally-oriented, any attempt to stimulate it through expenditure increases and tax reduction will have limited impact. We believe that a more effective way to address the problem of deflation without increasing our financial burden is to increase external demand, which means attracting more visitors, overseas talent and investment immigrants to come to Hong Kong; more foreign enterprises to set up regional offices here; more people to attend schools in Hong Kong and seek medical treatment at our private hospitals; and more foreign capital inflows into Hong Kong's financial market. These measures will reinforce the vigour of various sectors."
869,2003,Development and Prospects,"23.    In January, the Chief Executive set a direction for the economic development of Hong Kong in his Policy Address. We are implementing concrete measures to carry out the plan to develop our economy and improve people's livelihood. I will give a brief description of the following five areas: Big market, small government Building Hong Kong into a regional metropolis Developing human resources and infrastructure Enhancing core industries Increasing employment opportunities."
870,2003,"Big Market, Small Government","24.    We believe that a free market will lead to optimal distribution of resources, promote economic growth and create employment opportunities. In his Policy Address, the Chief Executive set out ""big market, small government"" as the underlying principle of the Administration's philosophy of governance. 25.    To contain the growth in public expenditure so that the public sector will not become a burden on the community is fundamental to realising the principle of ""big market, small government"". The target I set last year to reduce public expenditure to 20% of GDP or below in the medium term was for the purpose of restraining the growth of public expenditure. 26.    Second, the Government must continue to support the market in policy-making instead of participating in it directly. We will review our regulatory regimes from time to time and modernise rules and regulations to ensure that they remain up-to-date. The introduction of a new housing policy has clarified the Government's role in the housing market. The Government will supply land in response to market demand and provide low-rent public housing for those in need. However, it will no longer act as a property developer by building houses for sale to the public. The task force to be appointed by the Chief Executive will study further measures to improve the business environment. 27.    Third, the Government has also clearly stated that it would adopt the ""3R1M"" approach, that is to reprioritise the provision of services, reorganise the structure of government departments, reengineer procedures and make full use of the market, so as to optimise resources and provide better services for the public. Over the past year, some government bureaux and departments have been merged and more services have been outsourced. We will also continue to encourage private-sector participation in the provision of services and infrastructure projects."
871,2003,Building Hong Kong into a Regional Metropolis,"28.    The Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government has in recent years intensified its co-operation with the Pearl River Delta (PRD). We have facilitated the flow of people and goods by redeploying resources and streamlining procedures, and are building Hong Kong into a regional metropolis. With the support of the Central Government and the Guangdong Provincial and Municipal Governments, we have achieved substantial progress. In the fourth quarter of last year, the flow of people through the land control points was 9% higher than for the same period in 2001. The number of goods vehicles crossing the boundary also rose by 8%. 29.    We will continue to improve facilities at our boundary crossings and construct new cross-boundary links. In the second half of this year, we will begin the construction of the Shenzhen Western Corridor link to Shekou in Shenzhen. We are studying the feasibility of constructing a new vehicular bridge at Lok Ma Chau to facilitate the cross-boundary transportation of cargo. Moreover, the SAR and the Mainland are currently discussing the construction of a bridge linking Hong Kong, Macau and the western part of the PRD as well as a Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong express railway. The feasibility of simplifying visa application procedures for Mainland residents to visit Hong Kong is also under study with the aim of enabling individual travellers from Guangdong to visit Hong Kong in a personal capacity. 30.    Hong Kong is a strategic two-way platform for business between the Mainland and the rest of the world. To attract more overseas companies to invest in the Greater PRD and to set up office in Hong Kong, the Government will provide additional funding of $200 million over the coming five years for promotional activities. To enhance the effectiveness of our promotional efforts, we will work together with the business sector and the Guangdong authorities to run overseas promotions. Many local businessmen have expressed their strong support for such a partnership. They are ready and willing to contribute their time and make use of their international connections to help the Government promote the investment strengths offered by Hong Kong and the Greater PRD. Invest Hong Kong will co-ordinate such promotions. 31.    We are speeding up our discussion on the Mainland/Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement with the Central Government, with a view to reaching an arrangement on the main parts in June. We have made progress in recent discussions."
872,2003,Human Resources,"32.    Human resources are the cornerstone of a knowledge-based economy. A developed knowledge-based economy requires world-class universities to nurture talent. Many world-renowned tertiary institutions make use of private donations to enhance university education. To encourage universities in Hong Kong to be more proactive fund-raisers, the Government will set up a $1 billion fund to award matching grants to universities which succeed in securing private donations for purposes other than the construction of campus buildings. Details are being formulated and will be announced by the Education and Manpower Bureau in due course. I will also later propose to raise the ceiling for tax-exempted private donations. 33.    Apart from training local people, we will seek to attract more foreign talent to Hong Kong. The Government announced a population policy a week ago with proposals to ease restrictions on the entry of Mainland professionals and to expand the scope for investment immigration. We believe that, with more professionals coming to Hong Kong, our economic vitality will be enhanced and local consumer spending will increase, thereby bringing more employment opportunities for our citizens. 34.    Another idea to draw in talent is to attract young people to receive basic education here and remain in Hong Kong to further their studies. On completion of their tertiary education, they can apply to stay and make their careers here. This will help to develop our economy and alleviate the problem of an ageing population. Local students can also benefit from an expansion of their horizons through interacting and learning together with students from other places. In this connection, the Government is considering how the relevant policies, including immigration and education, could support such an initiative."
873,2003,Infrastructure,"35.    Some consider that the Government should take the opportunity of the current economic downturn to invest substantially in infrastructure. We agree. The Government will press on with projects that yield economic and social benefits to Hong Kong. The average annual provision earmarked for infrastructure works is about $29 billion over the next five years, similar to that for the past few years. 36.    At the same time, to speed up project delivery, increase opportunities for investment in Hong Kong and further the principle of ""big market, small government"", we will introduce a list of infrastructure projects for private sector participation on a trial basis. We will invite the private sector to submit expressions of interest on 10 or so recreational and cultural facilities projects worth about $2.5 billion. If private corporations can put forward development packages for individual projects, the Government will consider offering the projects through competitive bidding to the market for development. Depending on market feedback, the format for private sector participation may cover design, build and operate, or other options involving private financing. The Home Affairs Bureau is working on the details. We will consider extending the scheme, if successful, to cover projects under the purview of other bureaux."
874,2003,Enhancing Core Industries,"37.    To stay competitive, Hong Kong must excel in three aspects: quality, creativity and speed. The core industries in Hong Kong, comprising financial services, logistics, tourism, and producer and professional services, possess a considerable competitive edge in these three aspects."
875,2003,Financial Services,"38.    In order to maintain Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, we must move up the value chain to attract quality companies to list in Hong Kong and investors to participate in our market. The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau is working with the organisations concerned to implement the Corporate Governance Action Plan announced in mid-January. This will upgrade the standard of governance for listed companies and the quality of the equity market. Within this month, I expect to receive the Expert Group's report making recommendations on the regulatory structure and operation of the securities market in respect of listing matters to further improve market quality. 39.    With the rapid accumulation of capital in the region, Hong Kong is making strides to become the bond and fund management centre for Asia. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has already established a Real Time Gross Settlement System for the Hong Kong Dollar and the US Dollar. The HKMA has also established links with the Mainland's government bond and international bond settlement systems so as to reduce the settlement risk of bond trading. The HKMA co-operates actively with central banks in the region on development of an Asian Bond Fund to promote the growth of Asian bond markets. The Mortgage Corporation, Airport Authority, MTR Corporation and Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation will step up the issuance of bonds in Hong Kong. I welcome investment banks to enhance their fixed-income operations in Hong Kong, including secondary trading. 40.    Fund management is the core activity of the financial services industry. It is well-developed in Hong Kong, and the Government encourages fund managers to expand their business here. The Securities and Futures Commission has approved the issue of qualified retail hedge funds and will consult the industry on codes relating to real estate investment trusts. 41.    In order to foster the development of retail bonds and other financial products, we will introduce a bill to amend the Companies Ordinance by July to simplify the procedures for the registration and issue of prospectuses. We will make tax proposals to assist the development of the bond market and the fund management industry. I will return to this later. 42.    The insurance industry is an important component of the financial market. To enhance the effectiveness of the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance, we are studying arrangements to turn it into an agency independent of the Government. Such an arrangement is in line with international regulatory trends."
876,2003,Logistics,"43.    Hong Kong is one of the busiest container ports and air cargo hubs in the world. Last year, our port ranked first with a throughput of 19 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). Our airport has also ranked first in the world since 1996 in terms of its volume of international air cargo. Last year, it handled a record 2.48 million tonnes. 44.    The Government has done much to support the development of the logistics industry. As mentioned earlier, we are taking steps to raise the capacity for cargo traffic at our land crossings. More improvements will follow in the coming years. As regards maritime transport, the first berth of Container Terminal 9 will be completed later this year, and when all its berths are in full operation in 2005, port capacity will increase by 20%. To ensure that our port remains competitive, the Government will complete the site selection study for Container Terminal 10 by the end of this year. 45.    In recent years, there has been remarkable growth in our air cargo volume. Looking to the future we have plenty of room for further development. Last year, the Airport Authority awarded a franchise for the development of an express cargo terminal. The Airport Authority is also exploring opportunities for co-operation with the airport in Shenzhen to develop their potential further. To strengthen our status as an aviation hub, the Government will work hard to secure additional air traffic rights for Hong Kong. 46.    We are taking forward the development of a logistics park on North Lantau and the Digital Trade and Transportation Network (DTTN) system. DTTN will provide an open electronic platform through which relevant sectors, financial institutions and government departments can exchange data at higher speed and lower cost."
877,2003,Tourism,"47.    In recent years, tourism has been one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy. Last year, the number of visitors increased by 21%. The Hong Kong Tourism Board is forecasting a growth rate in excess of 8% this year. This encouraging development is attributable to the joint efforts of the Government and the tourism industry itself. It is clear that service quality is an important part of our competitive advantage. Many tourists choose to shop in Hong Kong because our goods are fashionable and of guaranteed quality. 48.    The tourism industry workforce in Hong Kong enjoys a high reputation for its service quality. Two ""thank you"" letters from Shanghai clearly bear this out. A tourist from Shanghai shopped in a department store in Hong Kong but forgot to take his purchase away with him, while another left behind a mobile phone while shopping in a leather goods store. On their way back to the stores, these two tourists were worried about how they would be able to explain their problems to the salespersons and retrieve their belongings. However, not only were they able to get them without any difficulty, they were also courteously treated at every stage by those they encountered. It had never crossed their mind that their plight could be resolved in such a prompt and simple manner. They recounted their happy experience to the media after returning to Shanghai. The magazine that published the two stories made the following comment: ""The Chinese tourists told their relatives and friends about the quality services they received and Hong Kong's reputation as an international city was built up. This shows that every individual makes his contribution to the investment environment."" 33 Refer to Yazhou Zhoukan published on 21 October 2002 49.    The Government will continue to promote tourism. New tourist attractions are coming on stream. In addition, we will work together with the business sector to create new lighting effects on both sides of Victoria Harbour. The light show held at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre during Chinese New Year was one such attempt. We hope that more can be done by the end of this year, when a new sightseeing ferry service will be operating. Visitors will be able to enjoy the most spectacular night view in the world from the ferries or from either side of the harbour."
878,2003,Producer and Professional Services,"50.    As the economic development of the Mainland continues, the producer and professional services of Hong Kong will have ample further opportunities. Last year, large-scale trade promotion activities held by the SAR Government in Chongqing, Shandong and Jiangsu were well-received, with many professional organisations and enterprises participating. This year, the SAR Government will continue to organise promotional activities in other provinces and cities, including the PRD, to develop business opportunities for the service industries of Hong Kong."
879,2003,"Creative Industries, High-Tech Industries","51.    The remarkable international achievements of the local film industry prove that the creative industries of Hong Kong have great development potential. We will foster this development by strengthening co-operation between the Government and these industries. We have set up a $50 million Film Guarantee Fund to address the problem of securing film production finance. The Hong Kong Asia Film Financing Forum, with the support of the Film Development Fund, will be held in April to help the industry to attract overseas investment. The Commerce, Industry and Technology Bureau and the Home Affairs Bureau will welcome suggestions from those concerned on promoting the development of various creative industries.

52.    The Government also supports high-tech industries. The Science Park is strengthening its support facilities to enhance Hong Kong's capability in integrated circuit design and photonics technology, thereby increasing the related industries?competitiveness in research, product development and design. We will set up a Wireless Solution Development Centre and a Digital Media Centre in the Cyberport this year to strengthen support for industries, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises, in respect of their technical development. Apart from facilitating the development of technology, products and services, this will give a new dimension to the growth of Hong Kong's creative industries."
880,2003,Increasing Employment Opportunities,"53.    Hong Kong relies on the development of knowledge-based and high value-added economic activities for survival. However, for some members of our labour force, the pace of economic restructuring in Hong Kong may prove too fast. Some industries have ceased to be competitive and their workers need to switch to other trades in order to find a job. To address this problem, the Government will take action on three fronts : First, continue to promote industries such as tourism and the local community economy, which can provide jobs for those with comparatively low educational qualifications and skills. Our tourism sector is making significant progress while development of the local community economy has made a good start. Second, reinforce various vocational programmes. At present, we provide over $1 billion each year for various training and retraining opportunities for those in need. The newly-established Manpower Development Committee will examine how to optimise the use of resources and will launch new training programmes and formats to meet the needs of the labour market better.Third, in the face of economic restructuring and the persistently high rate of unemployment, provide additional non-recurrent funding of $270 million to ease unemployment. Of this, $50 million is earmarked for expansion of the Re-employment Training Programme for the Middle-aged, increasing the number of places from 2 000 to 12 000. Another $26 million will be allocated for the provision of attachment training for 2 000 university graduates to enhance their job-related skills. The remaining $200 million, coupled with resources redeployed internally, will be used to extend about 3 600 temporary jobs. We will also enhance the training of local domestic helpers to improve their skills. In addition, we will launch new Intensive Employment Assistance Projects with an allocation of $100 million from the Lotteries Fund to assist longer-term Comprehensive Social Security Assistance recipients to get back to work."
881,2003,Economic Prospects,"54.    Looking ahead, external economic factors will continue to have a mixed effect on the overall economy of Hong Kong in 2003. The EU and US economies will still be affected by the unstable situation in the Middle East, whereas the Mainland's accelerated institutional reforms will support the continued growth of its economy. We forecast that our GDP will rise 3% in real terms in 2003, and that, in the face of persistent deflation, the Composite Consumer Price Index will drop by 1.5% and the general price level of the economy by 2%. For the whole year, the economic growth rate is forecast to be 1% in nominal terms. 55.    Over the medium term period 2003 to 2007, we forecast a trend GDP growth rate of 3% per annum in real terms. There will be gradual easing of deflation. Over the same period, our forecast trend rate of overall price change in the economy is 0% per annum and the trend growth rate of nominal GDP is 3%."
882,2003,2002-03 Outturn,"56.    I have already mentioned that our forecast fiscal deficit in 2002-03 will be $70 billion. Total government spending will be $243.3 billion, whereas government revenue will be $173.3 billion. I forecast that our fiscal reserves will drop to $303 billion by 31 March this year."
883,2003,The Targets and Pace for Eliminating the Deficit,"57.    Last year, I set three medium term targets for our public finances, which are to achieve the following by 2006-07:
attain a balanced Operating Account; restore balance in the Consolidated Account; and reduce public expenditure 4 to 20% of GDP or below. I remain convinced that these three targets are in the overall interest of Hong Kong. 4 Public expenditure comprises government expenditure and expenditure by the Trading Funds and the Housing Authority. Government expenditure accounts for the majority of public expenditure. 58.    To remove the uncertainty caused by the fiscal deficit and to restore investors?confidence, specific proposals must be made and carried out as soon as possible in order to demonstrate our determination. In view of the current economic environment in Hong Kong, we also need to avoid aggravating the problem of deflation and dampening consumer sentiment. In order to strike a balance, I will adopt clear targets, a practicable pace and a step-by-step approach to implementation in proposing revenue-raising and expenditure-cutting measures. 59.    We estimate that between now and 2006-07 economic growth will bring the Government about $30 billion in additional revenue. To achieve fiscal balance by 2006-07, we aim to generate a further $20 billion through raising revenue and another $20 billion through cutting down on expenditure in the next four years."
884,2003,Operating Expenditure,"60.    To contain growth in public expenditure, we must reduce operating expenditure. We are particularly concerned about operating expenditure, as it comprises expenditure on the daily operations of the Government and the public sector, and is rather difficult to adjust. Over the long term, the Government aims to achieve surpluses in the Operating Account so as to provide funding to finance capital expenditure. For the time being, we are unable to achieve this goal, but we must strive to avoid operating deficits in the medium term.

61.    The Government has now set a target to reduce operating expenditure from $220 billion, as originally estimated, to $200 billion by 2006-07. In controlling expenditure, departments will, through reprioritisation of service provision, reorganisation of structure and reengineering of procedures, ensure that essential services are not affected. The Government is committed to ensuring administrative efficiency through optimal use of resources, reducing the rigidity of government prices, and controlling the size of the public sector workforce."
885,2003,The Size and Pay of the Civil Service,"62.    The Chief Executive in his Policy Address announced that the establishment of the civil service would be reduced by 10% to about 160 000 posts by 2006-07, the recruitment of civil servants would be frozen with effect from 1 April this year, and the second round of the Voluntary Retirement (VR) Scheme would be launched. 63.    In addition, the salary of civil servants will be reduced to the level in cash terms as at 30 June 1997. This pay reduction will be carried out in two phases. With the full implementation of the civil service pay reduction, the Government will save about $7 billion annually on salary expenses and subsidies to subvented organisations. 64.    The Government will work out with civil servants an improved pay adjustment mechanism that better reflects the principle of broad comparability of civil service pay with the private sector. It is the Government's aim to complete this exercise, including a pay level survey, within 2004."
886,2003,Expenditure on Social Welfare,"65.    Social welfare is another item of public expenditure that has been growing very quickly. It now accounts for 15.5% of operating expenditure, with 10.6% for social security payments. The Government will continue to provide vulnerable members of the community and others in need with a basic ""safety net"", so that nobody will become homeless, suffer from hunger, or be deprived of schooling and medical treatment because of financial difficulties. However, in light of structural changes in the population, the increasing growth of social security payments demands our attention. The Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food announced detailed proposals on adjustment to social security payments last week. The proposed adjustments are based on the movements of the Social Security Assistance Index of Prices, and are meant to restore social security payments to their original intended buying power. The adjustments to social security payments for elderly and disabled persons will be implemented in two phases over the next two years. The proposed adjustments are reflected in the Estimates for 2003-04 presented to this Council today. 66.    We estimate that, after full implementation of the proposed social security payment adjustments, annual expenditure in this area will be reduced by about $1.71 billion. Despite this adjustment, we anticipate that expenditure on social security payments will continue to grow substantially in the next few years. We will keep the social security schemes under regular review to establish an effective and financially-sustainable basic safety net that provides assistance to individuals and families in financial difficulties."
887,2003,Doing More With Less,"67.    The resources we are using come from the public. We must use them cost-effectively. The Chief Secretary for Administration has designated the Director of Administration, together with the Head of the Efficiency Unit, to co-ordinate the efforts of departments in using resources more cost-effectively and in avoiding waste. The Civil Service Bureau has recently issued a circular to all Heads of Departments, encouraging colleagues to participate actively in the Staff Suggestions Scheme by putting forward cost-saving measures. I also call upon the public to give us their suggestions to help the Government optimise the use of its resources."
888,2003,Flexible Financial Management,"68.    Last year, I put forward some guiding principles to be adopted by the Government in the management of its finances. One of these was the planning of expenditure in nominal or money terms, in order to avoid the tendency for the rise in the price level of government expenditure to exceed the rise in the general price level of the economy. We have already brought this new arrangement into effect. 69.    Starting from this year, with the implementation of the accountability system, each policy bureau has been given an expenditure ceiling, i.e. the operating expenditure envelope. Directors of Bureaux now have greater flexibility to deploy resources within their operating expenditure envelope, and may retain for future use part of the savings achieved, thus providing incentives to save."
889,2003,Allocation of Operating Expenditure,"70.    Operating expenditure is estimated to be $213.6 billion for 2003-04, $212.2 billion for 2004-05, $203.4 billion for 2005-06, and $200 billion as targeted for 2006-07. Within these amounts, the Government will in the coming two years earmark a total of $8.6 billion to implement the second VR Scheme. 71.    To cut operating expenditure by $20 billion to $200 billion in four years entails a reduction of about 9%. In practice, the reduction to be borne by departments would be greater than 9% because some items, including civil service pensions and social security payments, will continue to increase. In order to achieve the overall expenditure reduction target, all departments will have to absorb such increases by making greater reductions. 72.    We estimate that the Government's total recurrent expenditure for 2003-04 will be $207 billion, an increase of 1% over the original estimate of $204.9 billion for 2002-03, with 23.8% for Education, 15.8% for Social Welfare, 15.4% for Health, 15.1% for Support, and 12.1% for Security. In preparing the future allocation of expenditure, consideration will be given to the community's priorities."
890,2003,Estimates of Capital Expenditure,"73.    The estimate of capital expenditure for 2003-04 is $43.2 billion, an increase of 0.8% over the original estimate for this year. From 2003-04 to 2007-08, annual capital expenditure will average $42.5 billion, of which around $29 billion will be set aside for works projects."
891,2003,Public Expenditure,"74.    Total public expenditure for 2006-07 is estimated to be $262.5 billion, or 18.4% of GDP forecast for that year, in line with my target set last March of containing public expenditure at not more than 20% of GDP."
892,2003,Considerations,"75.    It is necessary to raise additional revenue of $20 billion between now and 2006-07. The proposals that I am now going to make will raise revenue by $14 billion, and the remaining $6 billion will be raised by measures to be proposed as appropriate over the next three years. 76.    After thorough consideration of the impact on taxpayers and the economy, I put forth the following measures to help stabilise revenue, broaden the tax base, resolve the budget deficit, and ensure financial stability. I will also propose some tax relief measures to tie in with the population policy and promote further development of education and financial services. I believe that the proposed measures strike a fair and reasonable balance that is consistent with the overall interest of the community."
893,2003,Salaries Tax,"77.    I propose that the marginal tax rates and tax bands under salaries tax revert to their levels before the concessions made in 1998-99. The size of the incremental steps will be increased from 5% to 6%, and the marginal tax rates will be adjusted upward to 2%, 8%, 14% and 20% respectively. The bandwidth will be reduced from $35,000 to $30,000. 78.    I propose that the basic and married person's allowances revert to their levels before the concessions made in 1998-99, from $108,000 to $100,000 and from $216,000 to $200,000 respectively. In 1998-99, the allowance for single parent was increased by 44% to the same level as the basic allowance. I propose that the single parent allowance also be reduced to $100,000. Following implementation of the proposals, about 90,000 more employed persons will come into the tax net, thus helping to broaden the tax base. 79.    I also propose that the standard rate of tax be increased from 15% to 16%. 80.    Considering the prevailing economic situation and that the public's burden is still rather heavy, I propose that all the above proposals should be implemented in two equal phases in 2003-04 and 2004-05. This will provide some relief to taxpayers. 81.    In addition, I propose that the exemption for holiday warrant and passage be removed. 82.    I have decided that the allowances for dependent grandparent, parent, brother or sister, disabled dependant, and deduction for self-education expenses and other deductions should remain unchanged. However, in support of the population policy, I propose to increase the allowance for the third to ninth child from $15,000 to $30,000, equivalent to that for the first and second child. 83.    When fully implemented, the foregoing proposals will generate about $6.8 billion additional revenue for the Government in a full year. Detailed proposals concerning the salaries tax adjustments are set out in the Supplement to this Speech. 84.    We are fully aware that salaries tax increases will have a direct impact on the public, but my proposals should have limited impact on lower to middle income taxpayers. For instance, the tax liabilities of those with monthly incomes of $8,300 to $16,700 will be increased by an average of only $60 a month, with the effective tax rate increasing from 0.7% to 1.2%. The tax liabilities of those with monthly incomes of $25,000 to $33,000 will be increased on average by $410 a month, with the effective tax rate increasing from 3.6% to 5%."
894,2003,Profits Tax,"85.    I propose that the profits tax rate for corporations be increased from 16% to 17.5% with effect from 2003-04. In addition, I propose that the rate of deeming assessable profits for certain payments such as royalties be increased from 10% to 30%. 86.    I further propose that the profits tax rate for unincorporated businesses be increased from 15% to 16%, to be implemented in two phases in two years, in line with the adjustments in the standard rate of salaries tax. 87.    Hong Kong has a simple profits tax system with consistently low tax rates and many concessions. We do not have capital gains tax nor do we impose tax on dividends. The proposed rates are still lower than those in neighbouring economies, and the 18.5% rate we had in the 1980s. Our competitive edge will not be affected by the revision in profits tax rates. When fully implemented, the proposals will generate additional revenue of $3.5 billion for the Government in a full year."
895,2003,Property Tax,"88.    I propose that the property tax rate be increased by one percentage point to 16% and be implemented over two years in line with the salaries tax standard rate adjustment. The proposal, when fully implemented, will generate $70 million additional revenue for the Government in a full year."
896,2003,Motor Vehicles First Registration Tax,"89.    The motor vehicles first registration tax (FRT) was last adjusted in 1994. The 2000-01 Budget mentioned the need to review the scope of FRT exemptions so as to update the system. We have completed the review in consultation with the trade and found that the practice of exempting air conditioners, audio equipment, anti-theft devices and distributors?warranties from the taxable value is no longer appropriate in view of changing trade practices. It is now common for vehicles to be fitted with such equipment before import. Providing such exemptions creates a loophole in the tax system. I therefore propose to abolish them. In response to the trade's requests, I also propose to increase the bandwidths and introduce a marginal tax system for private cars. In addition, we shall make suitable adjustments to the tax bands and tax rates for revenue purposes. The adjustment in tax rates will be progressive and will have a greater impact on expensive vehicles. Detailed proposals concerning the adjustments are set out in the Supplement to this Speech. 90.    These new tax measures take immediate effect under a Public Revenue Protection Order published in the Gazette today. They will generate $700 million additional revenue for the Government in a full year. 91.    To promote the use of electric vehicles, we propose to extend the exemptions for these vehicles for a further three years to 31 March 2006. This will reduce government revenue by $400,000 in a full year."
897,2003,Air Passenger Departure Tax,92.    I propose that the Air Passenger Departure Tax be increased from $80 to $120. The revised rate is still lower than the past high level of $150. This will generate approximately $400 million in additional revenue for the Government in a full year.
898,2003,Betting Duty,93.    I propose that the duty on exotic horse racing bets be increased from 19% to 20%. This will generate additional revenue of $150 million for the Government in a full year.
899,2003,New Taxes,"Boundary Facilities Improvement Tax 94.    Last year I proposed to introduce a Boundary Facilities Improvement Tax to help finance the improvement of boundary facilities. Boundary facilities improvement works now being carried out or planned by the SAR will cost over $14 billion. We have looked into the details of implementing the Boundary Facilities Improvement Tax and have recently briefed this Council. The bill will be introduced into this Council in the second quarter of this year. This tax will generate additional revenue of over $1 billion in a full year. Football Betting Duty 95.    As announced earlier, the Government intends to regulate football betting and introduce a football betting duty. The Government has reached an agreement with the Hong Kong Jockey Club on a betting duty, at a rate of 50% of gross profits. The annual revenue so generated for the Government is estimated to be $1.5 billion. The bill will be introduced into this Council shortly."
900,2003,Charitable Donations,"96.    To encourage private donations to educational and other charitable organisations, I propose to raise the existing ceiling for tax-exempted donations to approved charitable organisations from 10% of assessable income or profits to 25%. This proposal will cost the Government about $100 million in a full year."
901,2003,Fund Management,"97.    To reinforce the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and to remove the concerns of offshore fund managers, we will amend the Inland Revenue Ordinance to exempt offshore funds from profits tax. This will bring Hong Kong in line with major financial markets such as New York and London. 98.    At present, subscriptions to and redemptions of units in Hong Kong from unit trust funds domiciled outside Hong Kong are exempted from the fixed stamp duty of $5. However, this concession is not applicable to unit trust funds domiciled in Hong Kong. I propose to extend the exemption to them as well. 99.    These measures will have minimal impact on government revenue."
902,2003,Debt Instruments,"100.  At present, only trading profits from qualified debt instruments with a maturity period of five years or more are eligible for a 50% concession on profits tax. To promote development of the bond market, I propose to reduce the eligible maturity period from five to three years, and grant a 100% concession on profits tax for qualified debt instruments with a maturity period of seven years or more. This proposal will cost the Government $17 million a year. 101.  In view of the present economic situation and the operating difficulties of the transport industry, I have decided to extend the duty concession for ultra low sulphur diesel for another year to the end of March 2004, maintaining the duty rate at $1.11 per litre. This proposal will cost $1 billion."
903,2003,Rates,"102.  The recent revaluation exercise indicates that, as a consequence of drops in market rent, rateable values of premises have fallen by an average of 8%. With the new rateable values coming into effect on 1 April, the majority of rate-payers will have their burden reduced."
904,2003,Revenue Implications,"103.  The above revenue-raising proposals will increase government revenue by $6 billion in 2003-04, $13 billion in 2004-05 and $14 billion each year from 2005-06 onwards. I will consider proposing other revenue measures in the next few years that will bring an additional $6 billion in order to meet the target of raising $20 billion by 2006-07."
905,2003,Government Fees and Charges,"104.  Last year, I announced that government fees and charges would be frozen until the end of March 2003. As most major fees and charges have been frozen for more than five years, and given the present serious deficit situation, I have decided not to extend this measure. I shall consider with the Policy Bureaux how best to adjust individual fees and charges."
906,2003,Capital Revenue,"105.  Land revenue is one source of capital revenue. Following the announcement last November to suspend land sales for one year, the Government will thereafter only sell sites initiated by application. While this enables land supply to better meet market demands, it has become more difficult for the Government to forecast its revenue. The Government estimates that land revenue from 2003-04 to 2007-08 will be as follows:
 
Year

2003-04
($ billion)

2004-05

907,2003,Government Bonds,"107.  Some have suggested that the Government should issue bonds, and employ financial management techniques to generate revenue which could be classified as income under our cash-based accounting system, so as to avoid substantially raising tax and cutting expenditure. The Government is not totally against issuing bonds. The questions that have to be considered are the use of the funds so raised, and the interest costs so incurred. 108.  Infrastructure is an investment in the future. If there is a lack of funds, the issuance of bonds is an acceptable option. The Government has issued bonds on three occasions in the past. The Financial Secretaries of the day clearly indicated that the purpose of issuing bonds was to provide funding for capital works projects. However, the problem before us now is that our Operating Account suffers from a prolonged shortage of revenue to cover expenditure. Issuance of bonds can only meet cashflow requirements but cannot solve the underlying problem. For the time being, we can draw on our fiscal reserves to cope with the deficit, and the cost of issuing bonds is higher than the investment income from the fiscal reserves. Therefore, we do not see any need to issue bonds."
908,2003,Consolidated Account,"109.  If the economy grows according to our projections and all the foregoing expenditure-cutting and revenue-raising measures are successfully implemented, we will achieve our three fiscal targets, i.e. restoring balance in the Operating and Consolidated Accounts and reducing public expenditure to 20% of GDP or below in 2006-07.

113.  In the next five years, our fiscal reserves will be maintained at a level between $190 billion and $240 billion, the equivalent of nine to 11 months of government expenditure, and lower than the 12-month guideline I proposed last year. As the community and the economy cannot cope with too vigorous expenditure-cutting and revenue-raising measures, I believe it is acceptable for the fiscal reserves to be maintained at this level, even though this is not entirely satisfactory. Nevertheless, due to the significant reduction in the fiscal reserves exclusive of the Land Fund, we will move an amendment Resolution in this Council shortly to permit the transfer of funds from the Land Fund to the General Revenue Account in order to meet government expenditure requirements."
910,2003,Revenue-raising and Expenditure-cutting Measures vis-a-vis Economic Growth,"114.  In proposing the various fiscal measures, the Government has taken into account their impact on the overall economy. The proposed measures will have only minimal impact since, based on the econometric model adopted by the Government, the growth rate of our economy and price movement will adjust downwards as a result by an annual average of 0.14% and 0.21% respectively between 2003 and 2007. 115.  We believe that the package of measures announced this afternoon will enable us to restore balance in our public finances over the medium term, thereby eliminating a factor that may lead to a financial crisis. Investors?confidence in Hong Kong will also be enhanced. People's anxiety about the future will be alleviated when they see that the tax increases and expenditure cuts in the coming years will be mild."
911,2003,Concluding Remarks,"116.  Madam President, the preparation of this year's Budget has certainly been a challenging task. I visit districts frequently and talk with people from all walks of life. In preparing this Budget and deliberating various proposals, I reflected on the people I had met and the remarks they had made to me. The thought of the impact of the Government's proposals on them caused me some agony and anxiety. However, it is the people's keen expectation and encouragement that has spurred me on. Over the past few months, many friends have told me that they understand the difficulties I face and have expressed their support. During the consultation period, Members of this Council, academics, experts, representatives of the business sector and local districts gave me valuable opinions and have helped me tremendously in preparing this Budget. I wish to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt thanks to them all. 117.  As a member of the community, I am well aware of the impact of the revenue-raising and expenditure-cutting measures. However, as Financial Secretary, I know very well that a persistent fiscal deficit will undermine our financial stability. The proposals I put forward today may have short-term impact, but will prevent larger, long-term problems. I also believe that today's proposals to eliminate the deficit are not so drastic as to impede economic recovery, and that they have taken into account the affordability of those who will be affected. 118.  Madam President, last month I had the honour of being invited to sing with Members of this Council the song ""For A Bright Future"" which has the following lyrics: ""We dare to scale the mountain height: from topmost peak our vision bright.""  5 Hong Kong people have conquered one mountain after another and this time is no exception. Our nation is destined to become a world economic power. Hong Kong is its most cosmopolitan city and a world city for the region. We can see clearly what is in store for us. Through perseverance, we will have a bright future.

With the additional job opportunities, the income of many grass-root families also rose noticeably.', ""8.Hong Kong's economy has been restructuring itself to move up the value chain and has created many high-salaried jobs.In recent years, our workforce has grown at an average annual rate of 1 per cent, while the corresponding rate for the more highly-skilled, professional and managerial workforce is close to 4 per cent.Today, one in three of our working population belongs in this category.Due to the strong economic recovery, the supply of certain professionals is actually falling short of demand.The number of full-time employees with a monthly income of $15,000 or above has risen from 470 000 in 1995 to 790 000 in 2005.This represents an increase from 21 per cent to nearly one third of the total number of full-time employees.In contrast, the number of people earning less than $9,000 a month fell from 1.12 million to 930 000, which translates into a drop from almost 50 per cent to 38 per cent.The number of employees earning less than $5,000 a month last year was below 6 per cent."", '9.I understand, however, that certain industries, such as those related to construction, and their employees have yet to benefit from the current economic recovery.Some small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have also yet to feel its effects, or may have been adversely affected by rises in rents and other costs.', '10. The strong economic rebound reflects the resilience of the market, and the tenacity and adaptability of our people.Self-reliance in adversity has always been our watchword. Our enterprises took the opportunity, when our economy was at its lowest ebb, to upgrade their efficiency and rationalise their businesses.That has greatly strengthened the resilience of our economy, and laid a solid foundation for the current upturn.', ' | ']"
914,2006,Economic Prospects,"['Economic Prospects', ""11.Last year, our nominal GDP surpassed its 1997 peak to reach a new high of $1,382.2 billion.Hong Kong has now fully emerged from the Asian financial crisis and has regained its strength and vitality.Our domestic economy has been moving forward with increased momentum, and we are better placed to ward off external shocks.I am cautiously optimistic about this year's economic outlook."", ""12.The external environment should remain generally positive this year.Following the macroeconomic adjustment the Mainland economy underwent, it continues to grow strongly on a firmer footing.Despite the threat of protectionism from other countries and overinvestment in certain sectors, the Mainland economy nevertheless put in a strong performance, with consumption and investment booming.Production has been gradually upgraded, and people's income keeps rising.Mainland provinces and cities are constantly improving their infrastructure, and market reform is deepening."", '13.The largest economy in the world, the US, has in recent years demonstrated its internal resilience and shrugged off a number of unfavourable factors.It has maintained steady growth.The situation in the US does, however, cast shadows over the state of the global economy.These include its huge current account deficit, whether there will be a larger-than-expected adjustment in US property prices following their sharp increases in recent years, and whether consumption in the US is sustainable in the long term by increasing debt.European economies have been clouded for several years by negative sentiment but have shown recent signs of improvement.The Japanese economy has gradually regained its vitality after emerging from a prolonged downturn.Most other Asian economies will benefit from the strong performance of economies such as those of the US and Japan, and show steady growth.', '14.However, the full impact on the global economic climate of increased oil prices and successive interest rate hikes has yet to be felt.Higher interest rates may also crimp the growth in local private consumption and investment expenditure.In addition, heightened geo-political tensions in certain parts of the world may also lead to further volatility in oil prices and financial markets.', ""15.Taking all these factors into account, and subject to there being no serious incidents or major external shocks, Hong Kong's economy is expected to achieve solid growth in 2006, with GDP forecast to increase by 4 to 5 per cent, slightly higher than the trend growth rate over the past ten years.As our economy continues to grow, the employment situation should improve further.Inflation will remain moderate, with the Composite Consumer Price Index (CCPI) expected to rise by 2.3 percent for the year as a whole."", '16.In the medium term from 2007?010, I forecast a 4 per cent trend GDP growth rate in real terms, and a 2 per cent trend rate of increase in the GDP deflator. The forecast trend growth rate of nominal GDP over the period from 2007 to 2010 is therefore 6 per cent.', ' | ']"

', ""18.For 2005?6, I am forecasting a surplus in the Operating Account of $5.8 billion. This is mainly due to higher revenue from salaries and profits taxes and lower expenditure. Operating expenditure for 2005?6 will be $194.7 billion, down from $196.9 billion in 2004?5. For the second successive year, following a half-century gap, we have achieved lower expenditure than in the preceding year.

The Mainland itself is growing at a fast pace, and will have different policy priorities for the various stages of its development, as in the case of its economic interactions with Hong Kong.We should identify those of our own strengths which can complement our motherland's development.I believe that taking this direction will contribute to our country's economic reform, sustain our own economic growth, accelerate the current restructuring and create more employment opportunities, thus achieving a win-win outcome."", ""21.For several decades, Hong Kong's economy has been undergoing structural changes.In recent years, our financial markets have, for example, evolved into the predominant fund-raising platform for Mainland enterprises.In the process, these enterprises have improved their corporate governance and promoted their brand names globally. Our professionals continue to provide more services to the Mainland and its overseas markets and, in so doing, make a positive contribution to our nation's development.Hong Kong's external trade has gradually shifted from re-exports to supply chain management and high value-added logistics services.This has contributed to the notable growth of our offshore trade."", '22.The development of high value-added commercial, financial and professional services has stimulated growth in other sectors, such as convention and exhibition, electronic trading, transportation, hospitality and retail services, and has enhanced our status as a cosmopolitan city.Today, Hong Kong is an important hub promoting the flow of capital, people, goods and information worldwide.We cannot, however, afford to be complacent over our achievements.To progress further, we must continue to enhance our competitive advantages.', ' | ']"

In respect of trade in services, the Mainland\ue5b8 markets have also been considerably liberalised under CEPA.Currently, 27 service sectors benefit, and more than 920 Hong Kong Service Supplier Certificates have been issued.We estimate that the implementation of CEPA in its first two years has brought about the creation of 29 000 new jobs.', '24.The implementation of CEPA III from the beginning of this year will provide further business opportunities for our enterprises and professionals.Our focus for the year is to ensure the effective implementation of CEPA.If any Hong Kong business encounters implementation problems, these should be reported immediately to the Trade and Industry Department, which will actively follow up.', '25.As a service-oriented economy, Hong Kong needs a vast hinterland market to promote its economic development.The implementation of the Pan-Pearl River Delta (Pan-PRD) Regional Co-operation Framework Agreement has greatly broadened the scope of our co-operation with the Mainland provinces and regions concerned, and will facilitate the use of Hong Kong as a gateway to the international market by Mainland enterprises in the Pan-PRD region.', ' | ']"

In 2005, we made progress in the diversification of RMB assets and liabilities. Hong Kong residents will soon be allowed to open RMB current accounts in a Hong Kong bank. RMB deposit-taking services have been extended to non-individuals.Moreover, to facilitate the further development of our RMB business and ensure the safe and efficient settlement of transactions, the Clearing Bank for RMB business will shortly launch a new settlement system being developed by Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited.', '34.Obviously, I hope that RMB business can develop more rapidly, and I fully appreciate the calls of the industry for further expansion.We need, however, to synchronise in tandem with the pace of financial reform on the Mainland and move forward gradually.As to the next stage of development, we are in discussion with the Central Government regarding the other two strategic directions, namely the proposals to allow cross-boundary trade to settle in RMB and to establish a RMB debt issuance mechanism in Hong Kong.

', 'These are only a few examples of the challenges that will put government finances under pressure.', ""51.On the macroeconomic front, I am concerned as to how much further the unemployment rate can drop from its present level of 5.2 per cent and whether the ageing population will push up Hong Kong's natural unemployment rate.Our economic recovery has led to higher prices and a rebound in property rentals.The CCPI rose by 1.1 per cent last year.Inflation has once again emerged as an issue to watch."", ""52.All these challenges will impact on our public finances.Over the past few years, we have implemented vigorous measures to contain expenditure.There is consequently limited scope for further cuts.Many of our revenue items are heavily dependent on the performance of our economy.In times of economic downturn, the risk of budget deficits will re-emerge.The Government's tax base is also too narrow: for example, only one third of the working population pays salaries tax.We also have to accept that land premiums and investment income, as volatile as they may be, are very important to our finances."", ""53.The more advanced and affluent a society becomes, the higher are the public's expectations of its government.We will inevitably need to increase government expenditure substantially, if we are to meet all of our community's demands.We will need revenues to finance such expenditure, although maintaining a low-tax regime is the wish of the majority.I am also of the firm belief that leaving wealth with the people is a key driving force for economic development.The biggest challenge in managing public finances is to keep taxes low while at the same time satisfying the needs of the community."", '54.My fiscal targets are to keep our accounts in balance and the share of public expenditure in GDP at 20 per cent or below over the next few years.For 2006?7, public expenditure is forecast at around 18 per cent of GDP, lower than most other developed economies.Hong Kong is an externally-oriented economy and thus highly susceptible to outside shocks.As our economy is also subject to cyclical fluctuations, there is all the more reason for us to provide against a rainy day when the economy is strong, or else we will have too little room to introduce relief measures for our community during a downturn.We need to maintain the share of public expenditure in GDP at a low level in order to secure the health of our public finances.', '55.We would naturally have preferred to provide more welfare to our citizens.We would have liked to develop more parks, piazzas, open space and cultural and heritage sites.But where is the money for all these going to come from?In line with our belief in small government and given our limited resources, we must manage our finances prudently.On the welfare front, we provide the community with a basic safety net and aim to build a just and caring society.However, we cannot compare ourselves with welfare states as our community does not accept their high tax regimes.Maintaining the share of public expenditure in GDP at 20 per cent or below, I believe, strikes a proper balance between keeping taxation low and enhancing government services.Following the principle of \ue624ig Market, Small Government?helps to maintain our low-tax regime and requires us to spend within our means. This is the approach that best serves the long-term interests of Hong Kong.', '56.We shall continue to maintain a strict fiscal discipline and ensure the effective use of resources.The Government will keep expenditure within the limits of revenues, strive to achieve a fiscal balance, avoid deficits, and keep the budget commensurate with the growth rate of GDP.', ' | ']"

Expenditure on Education, Social Welfare, Health and Security will account for over 60 per cent of this.In view of our improved fiscal position, I have maintained each Bureau's operating expenditure allocation generally no lower than for last year."", ""58.There is a widespread view in our community that education is an investment.I share this view.We will spend $56.5 billion on Education in 2006?7.For every university graduate who has passed through our education system, the Government's total investment exceeds $1 million.We are injecting a further $1.1 billion in total into the Language Fund this year and in the coming year, with a view to raising students' linguistic proficiency. Expenditure on Social Welfare will amount to $36.2 billion, of which $24.5 billion will be spent under the CSSA and Social Security Allowance Schemes. We will exempt non-government welfare organisations from the additional expenditure-reduction measures that we originally planned to help restore fiscal balance.Health expenditure will exceed $32 billion.We will convert the Hospital Authority's one-off grant of $650 million last year to recurrent funding from now on; we will also provide additional recurrent funds rising by some $300 million per annum over the next three years so as to strengthen the Authority's financial position and allow it to cope better with service requirements."", '59.We attach great importance to the prevention and control of infectious diseases.We have invested large amounts in, inter alia, enhancing the training of healthcare workers and stepping up the provision of infectious disease isolation facilities.We have in place the Preparedness Plan for Influenza Pandemic which has been developed in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines.In order to protect public health and in view of the recent threats of avian influenza, we have tightened surveillance and have enacted legislation banning backyard poultry keeping.We will continue our efforts to prevent the outbreak of avian influenza and have begun stockpiling antivirals.In the case of outbreaks, all necessary resources will be made available.', '60.Over the next five years, the Government will earmark $29 billion a year on average for infrastructure projects.We estimate that about 14000 new construction jobs will be created in the coming year.We will speed up delivery of the outstanding projects of the former Municipal Councils and other minor works projects.We will, as soon as possible, commence the major projects under planning, such as the North Lantau Highway Connection to the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and the Central Government Complex and LegCo Building at Tamar.

All these factors will bring greater pressure to bear on government finances. The Health, Welfare and Food Bureau is consequently studying alternative arrangements for healthcare financing, and will conduct a public consultation later in the year.

The Environment, Transport and Works Bureau will levy a fee on tyres and require the industry to be responsible for their recovery and recycling.As for plastic bags, the Bureau intends in the longer term to introduce legislation prohibiting their free distribution and to levy a tax to deter their use.It will consult the industry and the public extensively on the relevant legislative proposals.In the interim, the Bureau will agree a plastic bag reduction target with major supermarket chains and implement a pilot scheme.', '69.Hybrid vehicles produce fewer emissions than petrol-only vehicles.When further options are available in the market, the Government will consider using such vehicles itself more extensively and introducing measures to promote their use by the public.Separately, I propose to exempt electric vehicles from first registration tax for a further three years up to 31 March 2009.', ' | ']"
932,2006,Goods and Services Tax ,"['Goods and Services Tax ', '70.In so far as our existing public finances are concerned, expenditure is rigid and revenue, which is subject to economic fluctuations, is unstable. Land premiums and investment income are very important, yet volatile, revenue items. As a share of government revenue over the past ten years, the former has fluctuated between 3 and 28 per cent, and the latter between 0.5 and 18 percent.Our salaries tax and profits tax, which are the major streams of recurrent revenue, are paid by a minority of residents and enterprises, and such taxes are highly sensitive to economic fluctuations.The problems arising from our narrow tax base are abundantly clear.The existing structure of government revenue is less than healthy.We need revenue items which are less sensitive to the ups and downs of economic cycles to offset the volatility of the others.Widespread experience overseas has demonstrated that a Goods and Services Tax (GST) can achieve this purpose. I believe that it is the civic responsibility of Hong Kong people to contribute an affordable amount of tax.', '71.During the past two years or so since I became Financial Secretary, members of the community have periodically engaged themselves in discussions on GST, and have expressed their views to me.I can appreciate the concerns some may have.In working out the details of GST, I will follow the principle of maintaining our low and simple tax regime.The Government will consult the public on the detailed proposals.We intend, inter alia, to provide tax refunds to visitors and allow importers to defer payment so as to relieve pressures on their cash flow.To reduce the erosion of people\ue5b8 purchasing power, we will also propose relief and compensatory measures, including an increase in the level of CSSA payments and reduction of other taxes.', '72.As regards timing, we will launch the public consultation in the middle of this year.It will last about nine months in order to allow sufficient time for the public to express their considered views.After the conclusion of the consultation period, we will prepare a report and submit our proposals for consideration by the Government of the next term.

Currently, each taxpayer is eligible for a seven-year salaries tax deduction for home loan interest of up to $100,000 a year. However, the recent increases in mortgage rates have added to their burden.Therefore, I propose to extend the limit for the deduction by a further three years to a total of ten years, subject to the maximum annual deduction of $100,000.This measure will cost the Government some $1.2 billion in 2006?7.
